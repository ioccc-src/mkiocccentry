# Major changes to the IOCCC entry toolkit

## Release 1.0.9 2023-06-12

New `jprint` version "0.0.15 2023-06-12".

Make `jprint -h` exit codes formatting consistent with `jparse`.

Make `struct jprint options` in jprint.c a `struct jprint *jprint` as it will
hold other information besides options including additional structs. Added
`free_jprint(struct jprint *jprint)` function to completely free everything in
it and then itself.

Fix bug in `jprint` checking of `-` for stdin. It shouldn't be just checking the
first char as being `-` but rather the entire arg. Without this it results in
strange behaviour when say `-555` is the file arg.

## Release 1.0.8 2023-06-11

Fix `jparse` column location calculations where error messages just showed the
invalid token at column 1 even when the bad token is not on column 1.

Bumped `jprint` version to "0.0.14 2023-06-11".

When no `name_arg` is passed to `jprint` it will print the entire file. It was
never a condition that would cause anything but exit code 0 (assuming the json
file is valid) but it is now more explicit in the code as of 11 June 2023 that
the entire file will be printed once the printing code is implemented.

It is an error to use `jprint -p {n,v,b}` and `jprint -j` together.

Move the many options in `jprint`'s `main()` to `struct jprint_options` to
organise them and to help with passing to necessary callbacks later on.

## Release 1.0.7 2023-06-10

Release `jprint` version "0.0.13 2023-06-10".

Make `jprint -S -g` a command line error.

Use of `jprint -b [num]t` (or `-b tab`) requires use of `-p b` (or `-p both`)
and it is an error if this condition is true.

Add functions to parse `-I`, `-b` and `-L` options.

Use of `jprint -j` implies `-p b -b 1 -e -Q 4 -t any`.

But fix check of number arguments after options in `jprint`. The comparison was
wrong and could cause invalid number of arguments at command line even when they
are correct.

Clarify use of `jprint` `-I` and `-L` options in help string.

Add more test cases of bits.

Fix potential NULL pointer dereference in parsing of number ranges.

## Release 1.0.6 2023-06-09

New `jprint` version "0.0.10 2023-06-09". This version now correctly handles the
number ranges in the form of e.g. `-l 5:-3` where if there are 10 matches it
will print the fifth match up through the third to last match.

Fixed `seqcexit` and `picky` rules for jprint and sequenced exit codes.

Change semantics of `jprint -L` option. It now takes an option argument which is
the number of spaces or a tab which will be printed after the JSON level is
printed. Like `-b t` this has to be fixed in that we cannot assume that `t` or
`tab` is 8 spaces instead of `\t` but this will change later.

Further version update of `jprint`, now being  "0.0.11 2023-06-09". Semantics of
`-L` and `-b` changed further. Can be `-[b|L] <num>[t|s]` where `s` is optional.
If a number is specified without `t` it implies spaces. If a `s` is specified it
implies spaces and if nothing is specified it implies spaces. Anything else is a
syntax error.

Add initial testing of `-t type` option after fixing an issue with the bitwise
test functions. See `jprint_test.c` for details.

Release `jprint` version "0.0.12 2023-06-09": change semantics of `-I` option to
match that of `-b` and `-L`. Finished -t type test code.

## Release 1.0.5 2023-06-08

`jprint` version "0.0.9 2023-06-08". At this time I (Cody) believe all known
checks for `jprint` options have been added. Also test functions for the number
range code and print mode have been added and run successfully! To run test code
pass in `-K` to `jprint`.

The next step is to write some test functions (likely printing debug
messages for different options and their option arguments). Currently (as of
version 0.0.8) the number range test functions are successful.

If all is OK the code to traverse the tree to look for simple matches (this does
not mean the `JPRINT_TYPE_SIMPLE`) can be added. At first the tool will not
check for the constraints but rather just print the name and value (even though
the default is value (`JPRINT_PRINT_VALUE`) only I want to make sure that the
ability to to print both is there).  This will help make sure that the
traversing works okay before constraints are added. Prior to the following step,
described below, the grep-like functionality, using `regex.h`, can be added (it
might be better to instead add the grep-like functionality after the below - the
constraints - are added but this will be determined at the time).

Once the above is okay the constraints can be added. The tests should be easier
to do than the traversing and following parts but my hope is that in the coming
days more than tests can be added.

Once this is all done a comprehensive test script can be added to the repo that
is called by the entire test suite (including `bug_report.sh`) so that we can
verify that `jprint` works as expected. Then any issues can be fixed and the
tests can be run again. This might take more than a few days but hopefully
things will move along nicely.

## Release 1.0.5 2023-06-05

`jprint` now accepts a `-m max_depth` option to allow for one to specify maximum
depth to traverse the json tree, assuming it's valid JSON. Defaults to
`JSON_DEFAULT_MAX_DEPTH == 256`. With debug level `DBG_NONE` (this will change
to a higher level once the tool is complete or closer to being complete) says
what the limit is, indicating that 0 is no limit and 256 is the default.

`jprint` now parses the `-t type` comma-separated option. Currently is a
bitvector but this might change as more is developed (bitvector was not the
first thought).

New `jprint` version "0.0.6 2023-06-07". It now parses all options and most test
functions for options being set are added as well. This version is backdated to
7 June because this was done on the 7th of June but the version was not updated.

## Release 1.0.4 2023-06-04

Split the location table into `soup/location_tbl.c` and
the location table related utilities into c`soup/location_util.c`.

Updated location table `tbl[]` in `soup/location_tbl.c`
as of 2023 June 05.

Added `soup/location` utility to look up locations ISO 3166 code(s),
location names, of print the entire location table.

Release initial `jprint` tool. Current version "0.0.3 2023-06-03". Current
functionality is limited to:

- accepting SOME Of the options but not parsing any except `-h`.
- if not enough args (at least 1 arg - the file to parse) it prints usage string
(same as `-h` but with error message about not enough args).
- checks that first arg exists and is a regular file (or `stdin`) and if so it
tries to parse it as a JSON file. Depending on status of whether it's valid or
json it will report an error or report valid json. Later it will only report
valid JSON as a debug message.
- parsing options except that only the basic option arguments are parsed.
- note that `jprint` will make use of the `regex(3)` library.
- frees the parse tree prior to exiting.

Updated [jparse/README.md](jparse/README.md) to note the `jprint` tool.

**MUCH MORE** has to be done but this is a great start for a very important tool. We
believe that after the tool is finished and tested (including added to the
overall test suite + the `bug_report.sh` script!) we (i.e. Cody/@xexyl) can
import the jparse parser and tools into the [jparse
repo](https://github.com/xexyl/jparse).


## Release 1.0.3 2023-05-22

Added [remarks.example.md](remarks.example.md) which has instructions for
writing `remarks.md` files in the same vein as the
[Makefile.example](Makefile.example).

Fix `bug_report.sh` and `make clobber` (in `jparse/`) to remove bogus file
`jparse/lex.jparse_.c` after completion of one of the steps.


## Release 1.0.2 2023-04-14

Fix mkiocccentry to write past winner and author handle to the answer file. It
already read from these from the file but did not write them and therefore using
a new answers file did not work at the point that these fields were added to the
tool.

Improved the algorithm for UTF-8 strings to ASCII POSIX safe characters.
The `utf8_posix_map hmap[]` was changed to no longer map UTF-8 to
ASCII characters '.' NOR '+' NOR '-'.  The `default_handle()` function
was changed to NOT produce more than one '_' (underscore) in a row.
Before these changes, the function produced handles of the form:

```re
^[0-9a-z][0-9a-z._+-]*$
```

Now, handles conform to the following regexp:

```re
^[0-9a-z][0-9a-z_]*$
```

Moreover, default handles will NOT contain 2 or more '_' (underscore)
characters in a row.


## Release 1.0.1 2023-02-14

Fix minor shellcheck nits in `bug_report.sh` and
`jparse/test_jparse/jparse_test.sh` so that the `make prep` phase
_25 shellcheck_ will pass as OK.

Test if ctags is available before attempting to run ctags in Makefile rules.

The `jparse/Makefile` `make clobber` rule will call the same rule in
`jparse/Makefile/test_jparse` as well.

Make `hostchk.sh` grep usage POSIX compliant. This means it no longer uses the
either of the `-o` or `-h` options.

Corrected the comment about the Rule 2b value 2503.  The previous
comment, as noted by Nicholas Carlini (GitHub user @carlini), was
an out of date comment related to the previous prime 2053 value.

Fix issue in jparse/Makefile where sometimes one would see:

	make[2]: `jparse.tab.h' is up to date.
        make[2]: `jparse.lex.h' is up to date.

Added `jparse_` prefix to json parser so that multiple parsers can exist in
programs that link in the library. New jparse version is 1.0.1 2023-03-10.

Fix jparse/Makefile to have a dependency line for jparse.c (jparse.o). Run make
depend at the root directory.

Change `malloc_path()` to `calloc_path()` as it uses `calloc(3)` not
`malloc(3)`.

Rename macro `MAX_NUL_REPORTED` -> `MAX_NUL_BYTES_REPORTED` and allow overriding
it (default is 5; uses `#if !defined (MAX_NUL_BYTES_REPORTED)`.

Rename macro `MAX_LOW_REPORTED` `MAX_LOW_BYTES_REPORTED` and allow overriding it
(default is 5; uses `#if !defined (MAX_LOW_BYTES_REPORTED)`.

Fix version of jparse; the prefix added was supposed to be `1.0.1 2023-03-10`
and was changed initially but when trying to get a problem resolved it must have
been undone. Now it's instead `1.0.2 2023-03-11`.


## Release 1.0.0 2023-02-04

Resolved all macOS -Weverything issues worth addressing.  See
`test_ioccc/static_analysis.md` for details and to see how you can also help as
well as the fixes we applied, what might need to be fixed and what we ignore
(and why we choose to ignore them). Note that originally the commit ids were
bogus and although we fixed those in that file the git commit log obviously has
the bogus ids.

Restore Makefile use -Werror and use of -O0. With the exception of the dbg code,
use of -Werror and compiling with -O0 -g is restored in various Makefiles while
version 1.0.0 is still in development.

Fix some memory leaks detected with `valgrind`. See
`test_ioccc/dynamic_analysis.md` for details and to see how you might also help.

Exit codes checked for consistency across usage strings, man pages and the tools
themselves.

Changed DBG_VERSION from "2.6 2022-11-09" to "2.8 2023-01-29".
Minor improvements made on when warning messages are printed.
Added dbg_version as a global string for users of the dbg.a library.

Changed DYN_ARRAY_VERSION from "2.0 2022-06-09" to "2.1 2023-01-21" and then
from "2.1 2023-01-21" to "2.2 2023-01-22".
Added dyn_array_version as a global string for users of the dyn_array.a library.

Changed JSON_PARSER_VERSION from "0.12 2022-11-09" to "0.13 2023-01-21".
Added json_parser_version as a global string for users of the jparse.a library.

Moved JPARSE_VERSION "0.11 2022-07-04" from jparse_main.h to jparse.h.
Added jparse_version as a global string for users of the jparse.a library.

Changed JNUM_GEN_VERSION from "0.7 2022-05-01" to "0.8 2023-01-22".
Current JNUM_CHK_VERSION is "0.8 2022-05-01".
Fixed bug where jnum_gen.c had JNUM_CHK_VERSION.

Added SOUP_VERSION as "1.0 2023-01-21".
Added soup_version as a global string for users of the soup.a library.

Changed jsemtblgen so that -P prefix will always be used on function names.
Use of -M func will override any specific member name.
Changed JSEMTBLGEN_VERSION from "0.4 2022-07-13" to "0.6 2023-01-22".
The jsemtblgen tool, with the -I option, will not print duplicate
extern function declarations.

Fixed a number of tests relating to conversion of floating point values.
Corrected `jparse/test_jparse/jnum_test.c` test results for
the `as_double is an integer` test cases.

Added a system to notice "Notice:" messages and count then for `make prep`.
The `test_ioccc/prep.sh` tool removed the generated bug report log file
if the `bug-report.sh` tool does an exit 0, even if there are notices.
Changed BUG_REPORT_VERSION from "0.12 2023-01-24" to "0.13 2023-01-24".
Then with more improvements (see below) it was changed to "0.14 2023-01-30". The
improvements: check for Makefile in all subdirectories, check for overriding
makefile.local in all subdirectories and check that all subdirectories exist and
are readable and are executable.

Changed PREP_VERSION from "0.3 2023-01-24" to "0.4 2023-01-24".

Moved static variables from header to source files.

Fix segfault when author length is too long from NULL pointer dereference: due
to an else being left off from an if after rejecting the author, freeing and
setting to NULL the code went on to check for unique author names which would
then dereference the just rejected NULL author name. See commit
48ea6cc0bda39b2aa1e31fe42aee781197fe8b18.

Go through all files and fix typos and do a check for consistency in messages as
well (error, debug, general, warnings etc.). This excludes .json,  .txt and .err
files under test_ioccc/ as there's no point in checking them (some of the .txt
files do have text that would trigger spellchecking problems but they're part of
invalid tarball listings). The iocccsize related files have not been checked.
Where the alternative and incorrect English (that is American English) spelling
was in the repo it was untouched as it is after all the International Obfuscated
C Code Contest, not the Obfuscated C Code Contest for people who use proper
English. :-)

Fix some grammar errors. More could probably be done later but whether this is
worth it can be TBD at another time. There are some places that are problematic
in fixing and it's time consuming to find all the remaining issues. Besides,
this is for the IOCCC so if a few things here and there are misleading or
confusing it's probably not all that bad anyway! :-)

Improved man pages, error messages and documentation.  Went through all
documentation and fixed noticed problems, typos, formatting issues etc.

Add CodeQL Analysis for GitHub commits: added codeql.yml as a new GitHub
workflow.

Fix internal Makefile rules to do with the
[dbg repo](https://github.com/lcn2/dbg).
Fold in .gitignore from dbg repo.

Improve Makefile #! lines.

Fix shellcheck errors under macOS.

Moved utf8_test(8) to test_ioccc/man/man8.

Improve getopt() calls. We now control the error messages for better output like
removing "-h help mode" when -h is specified. Compress the '?', ':' and default
cases by way of new function check_invalid_option().

Fix bug_report.sh options -l and -x.

Improve dyn_alloc code robustness.

Fix several implicit signed conversion issues and double precision floating
point tests. Improve other fixes to various warnings.

Change remaining calls to strtok() to strtok_r().

Remove duplicate object in jparse Makefile.

Update README.md for information on how to help (for when we're ready for such
help). The note that we're not yet ready will be removed once we are.

Fixed debug calls in jparse.y to match the functions being called that changed
due to making the parser re-entrant.

Fixed various compile errors in systems that were not initially tested (debian
and linux in general depending on the issue).

Improve prep.sh so that issues reported are more specific. In particular it will
show which rule failed rather than just that a make action failed.

Change in txzchk the txzpath to tarball_path to be clearer what it is.

Fix double notices by bug_report.sh for unknown versions of tools.

Improve how bug_report.sh reports on missing commands.

Fix man pages to use formatting macros throughout and add them to the SYNOPSIS
and OPTIONS sections. This makes run_usage.sh (which was always a quick, dirty
and ugly hack) even less useful but not entirely useless. Update checknr call
in Makefiles so that checknr is aware of the additional macros.

Fix (prevent) stray jparse related files after bug_report.sh.

Fix potential NULL pointer dereferences.

Improve make clobber so that specific files and directories that were being
erroneously being removed no longer are removed.

Make it easier to make soup. :-) Yes this is for fun only and that sentence has
a slight hint.

Typo fix in soup/location.c: although ions have their place when peroxide ions
in particular combine with water and diluted acids it forms hydrogen peroxide
which has ended up killing people when those unaware of the dangers
misunderstand the request that someone would like a glass of H2O too. Thus we
should get rid of stray ions in the repo and now have. See commit
532d33773a198058a3d1d596ad1192cb7f3b35d0 for details.

Make parameters in usage() functions consistent across all files. Add usage() to
utf8_test.c and improve usage message. Change VERSION to UTF8_TEST_VERSION in
utf8_test.c.

Change boldness of foo([138]) in man pages so that only foo is in bold.

Fix usage message in fnamchk.

Change some local variables to not be the name of functions in the dbg library
(which the files in question used).

Improve iocccsize -h output. This includes adding version information to the
message.

Add version information to jsemcgen -h. More generally fix shell script -h
version in several scripts to print script name and version string.

Remove extra spaces in all_sem_ref.sh -h output.

Remove trailing blank lines to various scripts -h output.

Clarify comments about rule 2a and rule 2b tests.

Improve jsemcgen(8), jsemtblgen(8) and all_sem_ref(8).
Improve output of `jsemtblgen -h`.

Add FAQ.md for information on getting help with various problems.

Bug fix hostchk.sh. In particular in some cases it would be that the non-zero
exit code would be reported as 0.

Update dbg/README.md to refer to other dbg(3) man pages (the main files not the
symlinks). The jparse/README.md does not refer to an example yet (for the
library) as an example program does not exist. The dyn_array/README.md does not
explain how to link in the library yet because it depends on the dbg repo and it
is not yet determined how this will be approached. Similar can be said for
jparse though we do have json_dbg() and other related functions.

In order to make it easier to run tools from the top level directory, we
changed the default path of `fnamchk` from "./fnamchk" to "./test_ioccc/fnamchk",
and the path of `jparse` from "./jparse" to "./jparse/jparse".

Check return value of function `yylex_init_extra()` and warn with errno
information if non-zero return value. Sequenced exit codes, updated backup
parser files.

Remove unused function string_to_intmax() and change string_to_intmax2() to be
string_to_intmax().

Added `IOCCC_NEWS_URL` to `mkiocccentry.h` to define the URL to
read IOCCC news.  Added `IOCCC_REGISTRATION_READY` to `mkiocccentry.h`
to indicate if the registration process is ready independently from
the submit server.

Fixed coredump in verge when a version string starts with a non-digit
(`!isascii() && !isdigit()`).

Make verge use string_to_intmax() (instead of string_to_long()) and get rid of
the following unused functions:

        extern long string_to_long(char const *str);
        extern long long string_to_long_long(char const *str);
        extern int string_to_int(char const *str);
        extern unsigned long string_to_unsigned_long(char const *str);
        extern unsigned long long string_to_unsigned_long_long(char const *str);
        extern uintmax_t string_to_uintmax(char const *str);
        extern long double string_to_float(char const *str);

Exit codes were resequenced.

The `make tags` now forms both local directory tags files by the name of
.local.dir.tags as well as a tags file from the accumulation of tags from
related source directories.

Changed `soup/vermod.sh` default JSON tree from "../test_ioccc/test_JSON" to "test_ioccc/test_JSON" and default limit.sh from "./limit_ioccc.sh" to "soup/limit_ioccc.sh" so that `soup/vermod.sh` may be executed from the top level source directory without the need for using `-d test_dir` nor `-i limit.sh`.

Update versions prior to code freeze.

Updated selective `test_ioccc/test_txzchk` test files to account
for changes in MIN_TIMESTAMP made by prior use of the
`soup/reset_tstamp.sh` tool.

Added MKIOCCCENTRY_REPO_VERSION "1.0.0 2023-02-04" to the
`soup/version.h` file.

Fix `soup/Makefile` _clobber_ rule to remove the `soup/ref` tree.

Have the `test_ioccc/Makefile` _clobber_ rule remove
`test_iocccsize/`, `test_src/`, and `test_work/` directory
trees from from under the `test_ioccc/` directory.

Improved mkiocccentry_test.sh so that one can specify the path to various tools
that mkiocccentry needs.
Made txzchk_test.sh -t/-t consistent with mkiocccentry.
Added option to ioccc_test.sh to let one specify path to tar.
Changed IOCCC_TEST_VERSION from "1.0 2023-02-04" to "1.0.1 2023-02-05".
Changed MKIOCCCENTRY_TEST_VERSION from "1.0 2023-02-04" to "1.0.1 2023-02-05".
Changed TXZCHK_TEST_VERSION from "1.0 2023-02-04" to "1.0.1 2023-02-05".

Fixed chkentry_test.sh so it will work when running it directly.

Major updates to CHANGES.md. See
[CHANGES.md](https://github.com/ioccc-src/mkiocccentry/blob/master/CHANGES.md)
for details. :-)

Version 1.0.0 code freeze.

Formal version 1.0.0 release.


## Release 0.9.9 2022-12-31

Release just prior to version 1.0: the "public comment version".

The `make prep` and `make release` rules were made much less verbose.

Updated and fixed .gitignore file.

The jparse/ directory only uses and depends on dbg/ and dyn_alloc/.

Made changes to version.h so that the JSON parser code under
jparse/ does not have to use it.

Tuned the verbosity of Makefiles with various Makefile variables such as
${Q}, ${V}, ${S}, ${M}, ${INSTALL_Q} ${INSTALL_V}, and ${MAKE_CD_Q}.

Moved all man pages under their respective sub-directories.  The build_man
rule create a man sub-directory with copies of all other man pages.

Numerous updates and fixes to the man page set.  Improved how man page
macros are used.

Added man symlinks in place where commands are in a given man page.

Change IOCCC use of twitter to mastodon.  The mkiocccentry tool now asks for
an optional mastodon account.  The .auth.json file contains entries for
an optional mastodon instead of twitter.

The Makefile set, and the way they call each other has been improved.
Programs link to one or more libraries such as dbg.a, dyn+array.a,
jparse.a and soup.a.

Make the Makefile set reasonably consistent in terms of style and comments.

Removed use of man2html.  No longer are html files made from man pages.

Removed the checknr rule form Makefiles.  Instead, the check_man rule
tests man pages.

Fix the system of multiple Makefiles (more work might need to be done like
installing man pages with `make install` as well as other possible issues -
several have been discovered and fixed since this issue was 'closed'). Other
miscellany fixes have been made in the Makefiles.

Improve `bug_report.sh`: with `-l` (only write to log file) it is completely
silent and with `-t` fewer tests are run (don't invoke any of the make checks)
making it faster (note though if our programs are not compiled it will cause
some tests to fail: using via `make prep` will solve this problem). The `-x`
option will cause it to delete the report if no issues are found.

Improve `prep.sh`: make it much quieter if `-l logfile` (write to log file and
write less information to stdout) is used. Now calls `bug_report.sh` with
options `-t -x -l` via Makefile rule `bug_report-txl`. This allows for the
`bug_report.sh -t` to work without causing any problems. For reporting bugs one
should call `make bug_report`: `prep.sh` is for the maintainers of the repo.

The JSON test files used to test the chkentry tool were moved to the
test_ioccc/test_JSON directory.

Updated copyright to include 2023 (and a 'Happy New Year' to one and all!).

Add separate man pages for dbg(3) functions. Improve several of the man pages
more generally. TODO: make all man pages installed via `make install`.

Moved jparse to subdirectory.

Removed jparse.md and dbg.md in favo(u)r of README.md files in sub-directories.

Fixed dyn_array bug.

Moved dyn_array code to dyn_array/ subdirectory.

Fixed obscure bug with bool typedef.


## Release 0.8.1 2022-11-19

This "roll-up" release was added so that it could be referenced
in the https://www.ioccc.org/index.html news section.

Updated legacy_clobber rule to remove older directories no longer used.

Moved test directory to test_ioccc to avoid Makefile confusion
with the test rule.

Restructure dbg facility and Makefile in accordance with
the new method of copying code from external GitHub repositories.

Improve formatting with the hostchk_warning rule.

Added initial dyn_array.md documentation.

Typo fixes to the verge.8 man page.

Minor fixes to jparse.md.

Updated txzchk comments (source, header, man page).

Improved and updated README.md documentation.

Improved bug_report.sh: in particular in reporting versions.

Bug fixes and improvements to several shell scripts.
Made changes to satisfy shellcheck as well.

Added rules in the Makefile to make is easier to import code from
external GitHub repositories.

```
This repo is designed to be a standalone repo.  Even though we use other
repositories, we prefer to NOT clone them.  We want this repo to depend
on a specific version of such code so that a change in the code of those
external repositories will NOT impact this repo.

For that reason, and others, we maintain a private copy of an external
repository as clone.repo.  The clone.repo directory is excluded from
out repo via the .gitignore file.  We copy clone.repo/ into repo/ and
check in those file directly into this repo.
```

The dbg code is now a copy of the code from the dbg repo.

Update JSON parser version.  Changed JSON_PARSER_VERSION from "0.11
2022-11-04" to "0.12 2022-11-09".  There was an API change (an
addition of a filename argument in some calls) that suggested version change.


## Release 0.8 2022-11-09

Improve the situation with some systems requiring some feature test macros.
Removed all references to `${TIMEGM_PROBLEM}` in Makefile.
Removed all references to `${D_LEGACY}` in Makefile.
Cleaned out the `$(WARN_FLAGS}` list (from legacy hosts).
These changes allow for cleanly compiling under CentOS without as many
complexities (it was also important for modern systems like Fedora).

Made a number of important fixes to `chkentry`.

Made a number of important fixes to JSON parser.
Pre-scan documents and strings for problematic bytes prior to trying to parse it
as json.

The JSON scanner and parser are now re-entrant!

Improved JSON parser error messages by adding filename and location (lines and
columns).

Added filename argument to top level parser functions:

```c
extern struct json *parse_json(char const *ptr, size_t len, char const *filename, bool *is_valid);
extern struct json *parse_json_stream(FILE *stream, char const *filename, bool *is_valid);
```

This was one part of making the scanner and parser re-entrant. See the git log
and diffs of `jparse.l` and `jparse.y` for more details.

The documentation of the JSON parser is not complete and it will not be
completed until after IOCCCMOCK.

Fixed several memory leaks.

Fixed a number of typos in comments.

Many man pages updated and/or fixed.
Removed `limit_ioccc(8)` man page.

Made a number of shell script fixes with respect to the `mktemp(1)` command.

Experimenting with a system independent `make depend` tool: work in progress.


## Release 0.7 2022-11-05

Released IOCCC entry toolkit v0.7 2022-11-05

Changed BUG_REPORT_VERSION from "0.5 2022-11-03" to "0.6 2022-11-06".
Changed FMT_DEPEND_VERSION from "1.0 2022-09-28" to "1.1 2022-11-05".
Changed CHKENTRY_TEST_VERSION from "0.1 2022-10-11" to "0.2 2022-11-04".
Changed IOCCC_TEST_VERSION from "0462202-04-23" (sic) to "0.5 2022-11=04".
Changed TEST_IOCCCSIZE_VERSION from "1.1 2022-10-16" to ="1.2 2022-11-04".
Changed JPARSE_TEST_VERSION from "0.3 2022-10-22" to "0.4 2022-11-04".
Changed JSTR_TEST_VERSION from "0.4 2022-09-28" to "0.4 2022-11-05".
Changed TXZCHK_TEST_VERSION from "0.4 2022-10-20" to "0.5 2022-11-04".

The `chkentry(1)` tool is now code complete!  Added test suite for
`chkentry` called test/chkentry_test.sh.  The `chkentry(1)` tool
passes all tests.

Removed prefix in bison and flex code. The programmer's apology and
warning are still in `sorry.tm.ca.h`.

A test suite for `txzchk` was added.

Removed the `MAX_DIR_KSIZE` limit. There still is a maximum tarball
size but now there also is a limit of the number of files in the
tarball. `txzchk` and `mkiocccentry` were updated for this.

We're one step closer to being able to invite the public to
review these tools.

Created the test sub-directory.  Moved many test tools under the
test sub-directory.  Moved log files under test.

Created the man sub-directory.  Moved all man pages under the
man sub-directory.  The html files are also build under man.

Added the soup sub-directory.  Moved tools related to building semantic
test tables for chkentry under the soup sub-directory.  Moved ref
under soup.

Added fmt_depend.sh under the soup sub-directory to format
the make depend lines in a system independent way.

Added -Z topdir flags to soup/fmt_depend.sh, test/ioccc_test.sh,
test/jstr_test.sh, test/mkiocccentry_test.sh, and test/txzchk_test.sh.
By default these tools cd to the top level directory where the
mkiocccentry.c source file resides.  By use of -Z topdir, one can
force the top level directory location.

Experimenting with compiling code in sub-directories such as soup
and test.


## Release 0.6 2022-09-02

Released IOCCC entry toolkit v0.6 2022-09-02

Updated CHANGES.md for v0.6 2022-09-02.

Changed `MIN_TIMESTAMP` from 1655958810 to 1662145368.

Updated `mkiocccentry` from "0.40 2022-03-15" to "0.41 2022-09-02".
Updated `.info.json` version from "1.10 2022-06-22" to "1.11 2022-09-02".
Updated `.author.json` version from "1.13 2022-06-22" to "1.14 2022-09-02".

Improved code to use new facilities for output to a buffer from dbg release of
v2.5 2022-07-23.

The `chk_foo()` functions in `chk_validate.c` and the `test_foo()` functions in
`entry_util.c` are code complete, although they remain untested and unused.  The
`chkentry` tool, however, is not yet code complete. Later releases of tested
JSON semantic code will no doubt modify these functions.

Improved a number of the ways that JSON field values are checked.  In a number
of cases, code form `mkiocccentry.c` was moved into `test_foo()` functions so
that they could be used by other tools such as the JSON semantic test code.

Added code to generate JSON semantic tables from JSON reference files for
`.info.json` and `.author.json`.  The `jsemcgen.sh` tool manages this by way of
the `jsemtblgen` code generator and header, patch and trailer files (see
`chk.auth.*` and `chk.info.*` files).

Avoided the appearance of attacking any particular individual.  It was not our
intention to disrespect anyone, even though we disagree with some of the
technical decisions.  Where we have fundamental technical disagreements, we
attempted to express those technical disagreements with humour in hopefully a
more fun way.  As also now apologize for how `bison` and `flex` generated code
may look, instead of simply calling it ugly.  As such, we hopefully improved
some of the humour in our code while trying to be nice and friendly to others.

For example now the adjusted dbg levels in JSON parser are:

```
*     At -J 3, only the top level return type and top level tree are printed.
*     At -J 5, intermediate tree return types and tree are printed too.
*     At -J 7, also print grammar progress.
*     At -J 9, also print sorry_text and sorry_lang grammar values.
```

Removed a number of files and added a number of files under the `test_JSON/`
tree.  When the JSON semantic code is being tested in a future release, we
expect more such `test_JSON/` tree changes.

Improved / add a number of man pages.  Updated `README.md`.

Improved and expanded `txzchk`.

Added more test code.  We attempt to detect feathers in tarballs.  :-)

We will neither confirm nor deny the presence of an "Easter egg".
To to so would be "foolish".  :-)

Improved and fixed `vermod.sh` and `reset_tstamp.sh`.  Tested this
code by changing the `MIN_TIMESTAMP` as noted above.  The `MIN_TIMESTAMP`
needed to up updated anyway due to changes in the `.info.json` and
`.author.json` formats.

Made numerous improvements and bug fixes to the Makefile.

Fixed how `picky` is used in by the `make picky` rule for a few special files.

Added multiple rules to the Makefile including but not limited to `make mkref`,
`make legacy_clobber`, and `make legacy_clean` rules.  Applied multiple bug
fixes to the Makefile.

Improved the Makefile to be less impacting for modern systems while trying to
maintain, for as long as we can, compatibility with some older systems.

Attempted to improve compatibility with reasonably modern systems.  We managed
to keep CentOS 7 somewhat supported for now, although we may be forced to drop
support of such an old system before 2024. But if we do reach 2024 we can only
say that given that CentOS 7 will reach EOL in 2024 and CentOS 8 support was
unduly dropped and since < CentOS 7 already was at EOL this should not be a
problem. :-)

Users of very out of date systems can still enter and submit entries to the
IOCCC.  They just might need to find a more modern system to package and submit
their IOCCC entry, however.

Added stub code for `hostchk.sh`.  A future release will include mode tests for
the given hosts.  Future releases will also include a bug report system that
will also use `hostchk.sh`.

Improved the `no-comment` directive in `.info.json` and `.author.json` files.

Improved how `time_t` values are used and printed.  We no longer assume that
`time_t` is signed nor assume it is unsigned: we only assume it's time. :-)

Improved comments in C code about special `seqcexit` comment directives.

Make numerous bug fixes and fixed a fair number of typos.  Nevertheless we claim
this is *NOT* complete. :-)


## Release 0.5 2022-07-10

The `jsemtblgen` tool is code complete.

Added `is_reserved()` function to `rule_count.c`.

Changed the Official iocccsize version from 28.10 2022-03-15 to 28.11
2022-07-10. Updated `test_JSON` tree and `json_teststr.txt` to reflect the new
`IOCCCSIZE_VERSION` value.

Added and improved a number of man pages.

Added `Makefile` rule to build HTML files from all man pages.

Both the `parse_json()` and `parse_json_file()` top level functions of the JSON
parser return a JSON node parse tree when the JSON is valid.

Trimmed the JSON parser to not include code that does not strictly belong to the
generic JSON parser.  Removed dead C code.

Updated dbg facility to version 2.4 2022-06-26.  Version 2.4 2022-06-26 contains
functions to write (form) a message, debug diagnostic message, warning, or error
message into a string buffer:

```c
extern void snmsg(char *str, size_t size, char const *fmt, ...)
extern void sndbg(char *str, size_t size, int level, char const *fmt, ...);
extern void snwarn(char *str, size_t size, char const *name, char const *fmt, ...);
extern void snwarnp(char *str, size_t size, char const *name, char const *fmt, ...);
extern void snwerr(int error_code, char *str, size_t size, char const *name, char const *fmt, ...);
extern void snwerrp(int error_code, char *str, size_t size, char const *name, char const *fmt, ...);
```

Simplify command for jparse and jsemtblgen.  The -s is now just a flag.  Only
one arg is allowed.

Adjusted dbg levels in JSON parser:

```
*     At -J 3, only the top level return type and top level tree are printed.
*     At -J 5, intermediate tree return types and tree are printed too.
*     At -J 7, also print grammar progress.
*     At -J 9, also print ugly_text and ugly_lang grammar values.
```

Improved top level JSON parser debug & warn layering.

The `json_dbg()` functions now returns void, like `dbg()`.  The `json_vdbg()`
functions now returns void, like `vdbg()`.  The `json_dbg_tree_print()` function
now returns void.  JSON parser now uses `werr()` instead of `warn()`.

Now using `seqcexit` tool, version 1.8 2022-06-02 to sequence `snwerr()` and
`snwerrp()` calls.

Fixed a number of typos in comments and documentation.

Improved a number of C comments.  Some comments are less humor impaired and
might even make the reader prone to mirth and laughter.  :-)

Sequenced exit codes.

Improved C code format consistency.

The `-V` flag will only print the version string and exit. The `-h` flag may
print one or more version strings preceded by an explanatory string explaining
what the version is about.

Added date strings to release strings in `CHANGES.md`.

Updated `CHANGES.md`.


## Release 0.4 2022-06-23

The JSON parser is code complete!

The following JSON parses now work:

```sh
./jparse -J 3 -s '{ "curds" : "whey", "foo" : 23209 }'
./jparse -J 3 test_JSON/info.json/good/info.good.json
./jparse -J 3 test_JSON/author.json/good/author.default.json
```

Replaced `chkinfo` (was `jinfochk`) and `chkauth` (was `jauthchk`)
with a stub for a single `chkentry`.

Files of the form `chk\*` have been renamed `old.chk\*` and are no longer
compiled, nor referenced by `Makefile`.  Some of the code in these `old.chk\*`
files may be used in the formation of the new `chkentry` tool.

In `.info.json` the `chkinfo_version` was replaced by `chkentry_version`.

In `.author.json` the `chkauth_version` was replaced by `chkentry_version`.

The `IOCCC_info_version` in `.info.json` was changed from "1.9 2022-03-15"
to "1.10 2022-06-22".  The `INFO_VERSION` in `version.h` was changed accordingly.

The `IOCCC_author_version` in `.author.json` was changed from "1.12 2022-03-15"
to "1.13 2022-06-22".  The `AUTHOR_VERSION` in `version.h` was changed accordingly.

The `MIN_TIMESTAMP` in `version.h has was changed from 1652598666 to 1655958810.


## Release 0.3 2022-06-13

Improved JSON parser diagnostic messages.  Now, `./jparse -s 0` just prints
`invalid JSON`, whereas `./jparse -J 7 -s 0` prints a bunch of parser
diagnostics and  `./jparse -J 9 -s 0` turns on `bison` debug messages.

Updates to use new debug facility features from version 2.2 2022-06-08.

Fixed lots typos.  Make a number of text improvements in comments,
shell scripts, and documentation (both man pages and markdown documents).

Renamed jauthchk to chkauth.  Renamed jinfochk to chkinfo.
Renamed associated header files, man pages and comment references.
Adjusted shell scripts to use the new names accordingly.
Renamed `JAUTHCHK_VERSION` to `CHKAUTH_VERSION`.
Renamed `JINFOCHK_VERSION` to `CHKINFO_VERSION`.
Renamed `json_chk.c` to `chk_util.c`.
Renamed `json_chk.h` to `chk_util.h`.
Renamed `json_err.codes` to `chk_err.codes`.
Renamed `json_warn.codes` to `chk_warn.codes`.
Renamed `jcodechk.sh` to `chkcode.sh`.


## Release 0.2 2022-05-17

Several new tools and man pages have been added. Additionally the JSON parser is
being worked on with reasonable progress. The following tools have been added:

- `jinfochk` - check .info.json file (incomplete - dependent on JSON parser)
- `jauthchk` - check .author.json file (incomplete - dependent on JSON parser)
- `verge` - check that a version is greater than or equal to another
- `jparse`  - the JSON parser (incomplete as noted)
- `jnum_chk` - check JSON number string conversions
- `jnum_gen` - generate JSON number string conversion test data
- `utf8_test` - test translate UTF-8 into POSIX portable filename and + chars

See the following additional man pages:

- `jinfochk.1`
- `jauthchk.1`
- `jstrdecode.1`
- `jstrencode.1`
- `verge.1`
- `jparse.1`
- `limit_ioccc.1`
- `utf8_test.1`


The `-T` option to the tools has been removed as it was decided it is an
obsolete concept.

NOTE: The `iocccsize` is not listed as a new tool in this file as it was always
here.


## Release 0.1 2022-02-21

Created this CHANGES.md markdown document.

Added `-T` flag to `mkiocccentry`, `fnamchk`, `txzchk`, `jstrencode` and
`jstrdecode` to print the IOCCC entry tool set release tag:


```sh
./mkiocccentry -T
./fnamchk -T
./txzchk -T
./jstrencode -T
./jstrdecode -T
```

## Release 0.0

Released early versions of the following tools:

- `jstrdecode`
- `jstrencode`
- `mkiocccentry`
- `txzchk`

See these man pages for details:

- `fnamchk.1`
- `iocccsize.1`
- `mkiocccentry.1`
- `txzchk.1`
