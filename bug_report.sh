# 8343c4b8cb97e52df64fe8973e68f0d83c6090e1 where the exit status of each command
# was not checked properly which meant that even if a test failed it would not
# be reported as an issue which rather defeated the purpose of this script.
#
# As amusing as the thought is that there's a bug in a script to help report
# bugs and issues, this bug was not in fact intentional. :-) I had thought of it
# earlier on but I neglected to address it before the commit as I moved on with
# adding the tests. However since the world definitely needs more reasons to
# laugh I'm keeping this comment here for the sake of humour and the irony that
# I caused. You're welcome! :-)

# NOTE: This will indirectly call make fast_hostchk which, if it reports an
# issue, will be reported here. However we also directly invoke hostchk.sh later
# which will also report an issue so that one would likely see the warning more
# than once. If you only see the warning once then there probably is also a
# problem. The warning issued will suggest that you can file the issue with
# this script and it also suggests that you can get more information with
# running hostchk.sh directly.
#
# Obviously one needn't run this script a second or third time just because it
# runs hostchk.sh which suggests that you run this script each time it exits
# non-zero! :-) Sorry in advance if this (to make use of an American English
# phrase which I will happily use for a pun for a pun not made is a wasted
# opportunity :-) ) throws you for a loop! :-) But now that you're in the loop
# it shouldn't even matter. :-)
#
# This might seem extra verbose or overkill but we feel that if there's an issue
# with hostchk.sh it really is an issue that will likely prevent a successful
# use of this repo so each time the script fails we report the issue since it
# really is likely that, if the script fails, you will be unable to successfully
# use the mkiocccentry repo to submit a correct IOCCC entry.
