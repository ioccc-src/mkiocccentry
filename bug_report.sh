# get path to tools we might need for get_version and get_version_optional
# functions below
#
WHAT="$(which what)"
IDENT="$(which ident)"
STRINGS="$(which strings)" # this should always exist but we check anyway

# get_version_optional    -	try and get version of an optional tool
#
# A question is how do to determine the version of a tool when there's no
# universal option to get the version of _all_ tools (and in some tools we
# cannot detect the version as it will block instead or in the case of echo or
# yes just print the args).
#
# This is a good question and there's no guarantee we can obtain a version. In
# that case we will report it as an unknown version. Nevertheless we go through
# a series of steps as follows. First (step 0) we attempt to get the path to the
# command and then we run the following on the path (if it appears to be a
# built-in we cannot use the path of course).
#
#   1)	use --version (note: under macOS and BSD this will fail on several
#	tools and in some tools it will fail under linux as well)
#   2)	use -V (note: this might fail due to multiple reasons)
#   3)	use -v (note: this might fail due to multiple reasons)
#   4)	try what(1) (note: this is a macOS and seems available under some BSDs
#	as well - but despite the man page saying it conforms to to IEEE Std
#	1003.1-2001 ("POSIX.1") it is not available under linux)
#   5)	try ident(1) (note: this appears to be a BSD command that's not
#	available under macOS either)
#   6)	try strings(1) with showing just the first 10 lines
#
# As soon as one of these returns a zero exit code (except for what(1) which is
# described in the function below) we will stop. If we get through all steps
# without any results we will mark it as an unknown version.  The first step to
# succeed we will run a second time to record the output.
#
# Unfortunately this is far from perfect but we hope that it will help in a lot
# of cases. A note about what(1) and ident(1) is that we will only check for it
# once and if it does not exist we won't try it again. We also use the command
# command -p in hopes to get the actual path. This also might not be perfect.
#
