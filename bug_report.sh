# XXX - FIXME
#
# Currently the exit codes will not be correctly tested. The idea is here but
# the exit codes will not be tested right so if for instance make test fails it
# will still say that all tests passed. This will have to be fixed to make the
# testing of the exit codes useful but this will come at a later date.
#
# Yes it's very amusing that a script called bug_report.sh has a bug but amusing
# as it would have been I cannot say this was actually intentional! :-) I had
# thought of it originally but I neglected to address it until after a commit.
# This bug will be fixed at a later date as I must go do other things now. Still
# better to have it after all as who can't use more laughs? :-)
