 * chkentry - check JSON files in an IOCCC entry
 *
 * "Because grammar and syntax alone do not make a complete language." :-)
 *
 * This tool and the JSON parser were co-developed in 2022 by:

 *	@xexyl
 *	https://xexyl.net		Cody Boone Ferguson
 *	https://ioccc.xexyl.net
 * and:
 *	chongo (Landon Curt Noll, http://www.isthe.com/chongo/index.html) /\oo/\
 *
 * "Because sometimes even the IOCCC Judges need some help." :-)
 *
 * The concept of the JSON semantics tables was developed by Landon Curt Noll.
