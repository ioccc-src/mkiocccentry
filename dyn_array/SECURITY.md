# Reporting Security Issues

We take security bugs seriously.  We appreciate your efforts to responsibly
disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your
contributions for any verified security issues when they have been fixed.

To report a security issue, click on: "[Open a draft security advisory](https://github.com/lcn2/savelog/security/advisories/new)"

We will send a response indicating the next steps in handling your
report. After the initial reply to your report, we will keep you informed
of the progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask for
additional information or guidance.
