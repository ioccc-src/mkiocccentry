.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBfnamchk fnamchk [\-h] [\-v level] [\-V] filepath
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBfnamchk\fP verifies that an IOCCC compressed tarball is properly named.
.PP
The program validates that the filename is correct, in either the form of \fI"entry." ("test" or a valid UUID) "." entry_number "." timestamp ".txz"
\fP where \fBentry_number\fP is an integer between 0 and MAX_ENTRY_NUM (see \fIlimit_ioccc.h\fP) and where \fBtimestamp\fP is an integer number of seconds since the epoch.
.PP
More specifically, the filename must:
.RS
Start with "entry."
.PP
Followed by either test or a UUID string of the form xxxxxxxx-xxxx-4xxx-axxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
Where "x" are [0-9-f] characters. And yes, there is a "4" (UUID version 4) and an "a" (UUID variant 1) in there.
.PP
Followed by "."
.PP
Followed by an decimal entry number between 0 and MAX_ENTRY_NUM (see \fIlimit_ioccc.h\fP) inclusive.
