.SH NAME
jauthchk \- IOCCC tool to validate .author.json file found within an entry directory
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBjauthchk [\-h] [\-v level] [\-V] [\-q] file
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBjauthchk\fP is primarily used by other tools (not humans).
As such it should behave like \fBfnamchk(1)\fP in that if all is well, it should not print anything and simply exit 0.
If there are problems found with the \fI.author.json\fP file, then warning messages should be printed to \fBstderr\fP AND the \fBjauthchk\fP tool should exit with a non-zero status.
The use of a -v level may be use to assist in debugging.
.PP
The \fBjauthchk\fP tool is primarily a stand alone tool.
As a sanity check, the \fBmkiocccentry(1)\fP program executes \fBjauthchk\fP AFTER the \fI.author.json\fP file has been created and before the compressed tarball is formed.
If \fBmkiocccentry\fP program sees a 0 exit status, then all is well.
For a non-zero exit code, the tool aborts because any problems detected by \fBjauthchk\fP based on what \fBmkiocccentry\fP wrote into \fI.author.json\fP indicates there is a serious mismatch between what \fBmkiocccentry\fP is doing and what \fBjauthchk\fP expects.
