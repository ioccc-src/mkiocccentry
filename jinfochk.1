.SH NAME
jinfochk \- IOCCC tool to validate .info.json file found within an entry directory
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBjinfochk [\-h] [\-v level] [\-V] [\-q] [\-t] [\-W code] [\-w] ... file
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBjinfochk\fP is primarily used by other tools (not humans).
It behaves like \fBfnamchk(1)\fP in that if all is well, it does not print anything and simply exit 0.
If there are problems found with the \fI.info.json\fP file, then warning messages are printed to \fBstderr\fP AND the \fBjinfochk\fP tool exits with a non-zero status.
.PP
The \fBjinfochk\fP tool is primarily a stand alone tool.
As a sanity check, the \fBmkiocccentry(1)\fP program executes \fBjinfochk\fP AFTER the \fI.info.json\fP file has been created and before the compressed tarball is formed.
If \fBmkiocccentry\fP program sees a 0 exit status, then all is well.
For a non-zero exit code, the tool aborts because any problems detected by \fBjinfochk\fP based on what \fBmkiocccentry\fP wrote into \fI.info.json\fP indicates there is a serious mismatch between what \fBmkiocccentry\fP is doing and what \fBjinfochk\fP expects.

Add code to the list of JSON codes to ignore.
To ignore more than one JSON code, use multiple \fB\-W code\fP on the command line.
Note: 0 (which is reserved) notwithstanding the code is in decimal (not octal) despite the fact the codes up through 999 are 0-padded; we explicitly parse the codes as decimal, not octal.
