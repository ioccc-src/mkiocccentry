/*
 * jinfochk - IOCCC JSON .info.json checker and validator. Invoked by
 * mkiocccentry after the .info.json file has been created but prior to forming
 * the .author.json file, validating it with jauthchk and then forming the
 * tarball.
 *
 * "Because sometimes even the IOCCC Judges need some help." :-)
 *
 * This tool is currently being worked on by:
 *
 *	@xexyl
 *	https://xexyl.net		Cody Boone Ferguson
 *	https://ioccc.xexyl.net
 *
 * NOTE: This tool and jauthchk is (and are) very much a work(s) in progress and
 * as of 10 March 2022 it was decided that the parsing should be done via
 * flex(1) and bison(1) which will require some time and thought. In time the
 * two tools will be merged into one which can parse one or both of .info.json
 * and/or .author.json. This is because some fields MUST be the same value in
 * both files.
 *
 * Additionally there will likely be a jparse tool that will take a block of
 * memory from either stdin or a file and attempt to parse it as json.
