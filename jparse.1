For more detailed history that goes beyond this humble man page we recommend you check \fBjparse(1)\fP, \fBchkentry(1)\fP, \fICHANGES.md\fP, \fIREADME.md\fP, the GitHub git log as well as reading the source code (or not :\-) ).
Understand that by source we refer to the \fIjparse.l\fP and \fIjparse.y\fP files: we do NOT recommend you read the generated code!
This is because doing so is likely to give you nightmares and cause other horrible symptoms.
See the apology at the top of the generated files or look directly at \fIsorry.tm.ca.h\fP instead.
.PP
We don't recommend you check the GitHub issue page! :\-)
This is because it's incredibly long with a lot of OT things and would take even the fastest readers a very long time to read. :\-(
.PP
.SH BUGS
.PP
Better error reporting and various other things need to be added.
For example showing the file name and line number have to be added.
.PP
It's not yet fully re\-entrant.
