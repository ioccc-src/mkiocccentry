/*
 * An IOCCC satirical take on flex and bison
 *
 * As we utterly object to the hideous code that flex and bison generate we
 * point it out in an ironic way by changing the prefix yy to ugly_ so that
 * flex actually calls itself ugly. This is satire for the IOCCC (although we
 * still believe that flex generates ugly code)!
 *
 * This means that for some symbols later in the file we use ugly_ instead of
 * yy. For example it's ugly_lval instead of yylval and best of all ugly_parse()
 * for it _is_ an ugly parser. Another one is ugly_error() instead of yyerror().
 *
 * A negative consequence here is that because of the prefix being set to
 * ugly_ there's a typedef in the parser that _might_ suggest _our_ struct json
 * is ugly:
 *
 *	typedef struct json UGLY_STYPE;
 *
 * At first glance this is a valid concern. However we argue that even if this
 * is so the struct might well have to be ugly because it's for a json parser; a
 * json parser necessarily has to be ugly due to the spec: one could easily be
 * forgiven for wondering if the authors of the json specification were on drugs
 * at the time of writing them!
 *
 * Please note that we're _ABSOLUTELY NOT_ saying that they were and we use the
 * term very loosely as well: we do not want to and we are not accusing anyone
 * of being on drugs (we rather find addiction a real tragedy and anyone with an
 * addiction should be treated well and given the help they need) but the fact
 * is that the JSON specification is barmy and those who are in favour of it
 * must surely be in the JSON Barmy Army (otherwise known as the Barmy Army
 * Jointly Staying On Narcotics :-)).
 *
 * Thus as much as we find the specification objectionable we rather feel sorry
 * for those poor lost souls who are indeed in the JSON Barmy Army and we
 * apologise to them in a light and fun way and with hope that they're not
 * terribly humour impaired. :-)
 *
 * BTW: If you want to see all the symbols (re?)defined to something ugly run:
 *
 *	grep -i '#[[:space:]]*define[[:space:]].*ugly_' *.c
 *
 * after generating the files; and if you want to see only what was changed from
 * yy or YY to refer to ugly_ or UGLY_:
 *
 *	grep -i '#[[:space:]]*define[[:space:]]*yy.*ugly_' *.c
 *
 * This will help you find the right symbols should you need them. If (as is
 * likely to happen) the parser is split into another repo for a json parser by
 * itself I will possibly remove this prefix: this is as satire for the IOCCC
 * (though we all believe that the generated code is in fact ugly).
 *
 * WARNING: Although we use the prefix ugly_ the scanner and parser will at
 * times refer to yy and YY and other times refer to ugly_ and UGLY_ (partly
 * because WE refer to ugly_ and UGLY_). So if you're trying to sift through
 * that ugly spaghetti code (which we strongly recommend you do not do as it will
 * likely cause nightmares and massive brain pain) you'll want to check yy/YY as
 * well as ugly_/UGLY_. But really you oughtn't try and go through that code so
 * you need only pay attention to the ugly_ and UGLY_ prefixes (in the *.l and
 * *.y files) which again are satire for the IOCCC. See also the apology in the
 * generated files or directly looking at sorry.tm.ca.h.
