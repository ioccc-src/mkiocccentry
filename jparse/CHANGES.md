# Significant changes in the JSON parser repo

## Release 1.0.3 2024-09-08

Fix `make clobber` to remove `jparse_test.log` and `Makefile.orig`.

Fix `make legacy_clobber` to remove `jparse.a`.

Fix `${RM}` in Makefiles to use `${Q}` variable (not in `make depend` as it is
used in an earlier command in the multiple line commands), in some cases changed
from the wrong variable, and `${RM_V}` (where this was not done).

Do not use `-r` in rm in Makefiles unless removing a directory, for safety.

Make `rm` in Makefiles silent by default (as in do not use `-v`).


## Release 1.0.2 2024-09-07

Improve error messages if invalid JSON in the following ways:

- If verbosity level is > 0, then it will show the invalid token and hex value
of that token (along with the line and column).
- If verbosity is not specified, then it will just show the syntax error (the
bad token with the line and column) and then the warning that the JSON tree is
NULL (just like if verbosity specified) and then the error message (from
`jparse(1)` itself).

The error files in the `bad_loc` have been updated as now the error output has
changed.

Updated `jparse(1)` version to 1.1.6 2024-09-07.


## Release 1.0.1 2024-09-06

Add option `-L` to `jparse_test.sh` to skip error location tests. This is useful
in the case one has a different directory structure or the need of options that
change the paths causes incorrect error files.

`jparse_test.sh` now will try the default JSON strings files if no file is given
on the command line.

Updated man page `jparse_test.8`.

The new version of `jparse_test.sh` is `1.0.6 2024-09-06`.

Removed where necessary some references to the [IOCCC](https://www.ioccc.org)
and the [mkiocccentry repo](https://github.com/ioccc-src/mkiocccentry), changing
some to [this repo](https://github.com/xexyl/jparse).

Don't report 'valid JSON' in `jparse` unless verbosity level > 0. It is still an
error if the JSON is invalid.
