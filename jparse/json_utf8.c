 * which we leave for posterity, even though we no longer use their code (the
 * constants notwithstanding as we have no choice in the matter):
 *
 * UTF8 valid ranges
 *
 * The UTF-8 decoding spreads the bits of a 32bit word over several
 * bytes. This table gives the ranges that can be held and how they'd
 * be represented.
 *
 * 0x00000000 0x0000007F: 0xxxxxxx
 * 0x00000000 0x000007FF: 110xxxxx 10xxxxxx
 * 0x00000000 0x0000FFFF: 1110xxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx
 * 0x00000000 0x001FFFFF: 11110xxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx
 * 0x00000000 0x03FFFFFF: 111110xx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx
 * 0x00000000 0x7FFFFFFF: 1111110x 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx
 *
 * There is an additional requirement on UTF-8, in that only the
 * shortest representation of a 32bit value is to be used.  A encoder
 * must not encode sequences that do not satisfy this requirement.
 * Thus the allowed ranges have a lower bound.
 *
 * 0x00000000 0x0000007F: 0xxxxxxx
 * 0x00000080 0x000007FF: 110xxxxx 10xxxxxx
 * 0x00000800 0x0000FFFF: 1110xxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx
 * 0x00010000 0x001FFFFF: 11110xxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx
 * 0x00200000 0x03FFFFFF: 111110xx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx
 * 0x04000000 0x7FFFFFFF: 1111110x 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx
 *
 * Actual unicode characters are limited to the range 0x0 - 0x10FFFF,
 * 17 planes of 65536 values.  This limits the sequences actually seen
 * even more, to just the following.
 *
 *          0 -     0x7f: 0                     0x7f
 *       0x80 -    0x7ff: 0xc2 0x80             0xdf 0xbf
 *      0x800 -   0xffff: 0xe0 0xa0 0x80        0xef 0xbf 0xbf
 *    0x10000 - 0x10ffff: 0xf0 0x90 0x80 0x80   0xf4 0x8f 0xbf 0xbf
 *
 * Even within those ranges not all values are allowed: the surrogates
 * 0xd800 - 0xdfff should never be seen.
 *
 * Note that the longest sequence seen with valid usage is 4 bytes,
 * the same a single UTF-32 character.  This makes the UTF-8
 * representation of Unicode strictly smaller than UTF-32.
 *
 * The shortest sequence requirement was introduced by:
 *    Corrigendum #1: UTF-8 Shortest Form
 * It can be found here:
 *    http://www.unicode.org/versions/corrigendum1.html
