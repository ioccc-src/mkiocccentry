.SH DESCRIPTION
.B jstrencode
converts JSON decoded strings into a normal strings.
If given the
.B \-Q
option, the program skips double quotes that enclose each arg's concatenation.
If given the
.B \-e
option it will skip double quotes that enclose each arg.
To ignore newlines in the input, use the
.B \-N
option.
On the other hand, if you do not want a newline printed after the output, use the
.B \-n
option.
By default the program reads from
.BR stdin ,
if no arg is specified.
Otherwise it will act on the arguments to the program.
.PP
If given the
.B \-t
option it performs a test on the JSON encode and decode functions.

.SH BUGS
.PP
A known problem with macOS Terminal is that one has to hit ctrl\-d twice in order for it to properly send
.B EOF
but this occurs in other applications as well so we note this issue here.
.PP
It is worth remembering that, for the
.B \-Q
option, if the string is not enclosed in double quotes (in other words, the first character and last character are both double quotes), the quote will not be removed, as it's not enclosed in double quotes.
.PP
If you have an issue with the tool you can report it at
.br
\fI\<https://github.com/xexyl/jparse/issues\>\fP.
.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
Decode the JSON string
.BR {\ "test_mode"\ :\ false\ } :
.sp
.RS
.ft B
 jstrencode { "test_mode" : false }
.ft R
.RE
.sp
Note that we didn't quote it!
.PP
Decode a string containing an escaped double quote from
.B stdin
(send
.BR EOF ,
usually ctrl\-d or
.BR ^D ,
to encode):
.sp
.RS
.ft B
 jstrencode
 {"test\e"ing":false}
 ^D
.ft R
.RE
.PP
Decode just a negative number:
.sp
.RS
.ft B
 jstrencode \-\- \-5
.ft R
.RE
Ignore newlines in input:
.sp
.RS
.ft B
 printf "foo\\\\nbar" | jstrencode -N
.ft R
.RE
.PP
Skip double quotes that enclose each arg's concatenation:
.sp
.RS
.ft B
 jstrencode -Q '"foo"' bar baz
.ft R
.RE
.PP
Run test mode:
.sp
.RS
.ft B
 jstrencode \-t
.ft R
.RE
.PP
Have some fun:
.sp
.RS
.ft B
 jstrencode -E 1
.ft R
.RE
.PP
Have even more fun:
.sp
