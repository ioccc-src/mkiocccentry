.SH NAME
jstr_test.sh \- JSON string encoding and decoding tests
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBjstr_test.sh\fP [\-h] [\-V] [\-v level] [\-e jstrencode] [\-d jstrdecode]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Using \fBjstrencode(1)\fP and \fBjstrdecode(1)\fP the \fBjstr_test.sh\fP script runs a series of tests to make sure that both encoding and decoding of JSON strings work as expected.
This is important because if either is not working right then there will be a problem with the JSON parser as well as these tools use the same routines that the JSON parser uses.

.SH FILES
\fIjstr_test.out\fP
.RS
This temporary file holds the output of an encoded JSON string (via \fBjstrencode(1)\fP) decoded by \fBjstrdecode(1)\fP which, along with \fIjstr_test2.out\fP, is used to to verify that encoding and decoding work.
If the file exists and cannot be removed the script will exit with code 102.
In the script this file is the variable \fBTEST_FILE\fP.
When the script ends this file should be deleted but the script attempts to delete it, upon execution, in case it still exists or was created by some other process.

.SH NOTES
The JSON parser \fBjparse\fP was co\-developed by Cody Boone Ferguson and Landon Curt Noll (one of the IOCCC Judges) in support for IOCCCMOCK, IOCCC28 and beyond.
.SH BUGS
If you have a problem with the tool (not JSON itself! :\-) ) you can report it at the GitHub issues page.
