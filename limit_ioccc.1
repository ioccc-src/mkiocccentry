.SH NAME
limit_ioccc.sh \- select \fIlimit_ioccc.h\fP and \fIversion.h\fP values for shell script use
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBsource limit_ioccc.sh\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBlimit_ioccc.sh\fP contains a list of some of the values that are in the \fIlimit_ioccc.h\fP and \fIversion.h\fP files.
.PP
The following is a list of all the variables that are in the file.
.PP
\fB*_VERSION\fP values in \fIversion.h\fP and \fBDBG_VERSION\fP in \fIdbg.h\fP.
.PP
\fBRULE_2A_SIZE\fP and \fBRULE_2B_SIZE\fP in \fIlimit_ioccc.h\fP.
These are for the famous rule 2a and rule 2b.
.PP
\fBMAX_*\fP in \fIlimit_ioccc.h\fP.
Some of these are limits in the contest, some are limits on authors and others on entries themselves.
For example \fBMAX_TWITTER_LEN\fP says how long Twitter handles can be including the \fB@\fP.
\fBMAX_HANDLE\fP is the maximum length of an IOCCC winner handle.
\fBMAX_TARBALL_LEN\fP is the maximum size of the compressed tarball in bytes.
\fBMAX_TIMESTAMP_LEN\fP is for internal use and is of no concern for contestants.
.PP
\fBMIN_*\fP values in \fIlimit_ioccc.h\fP.
Currently there is only one such value and it's worth a special mention: \fBMIN_TIMESTAMP\fP is the timestamp that an entry timestamp must be >= for it to be a valid entry.
To put it another way: an entry timestamp < \fBMIN_TIMESTAMP\fP is an invalid timestamp and thus an invalid entry.
.PP
\fBUUID_LEN\fP, \fBUUID_VERSION\fP and \fBUUID_VARIANT\fP in \fIlimit_ioccc.h\fP.
.PP
\fBIOCCC_*\fP in \fIlimit_ioccc.h\fP.
.PP
\fBTIMESTAMP_EPOCH\fP in \fIlimit_ioccc.h\fP.
This is the \fBgettimeofday(2)\fP epoch.
.PP
\fBDIGRAPHS\fP and \fBTRIGRAPHS\fP, both of which are specific to \fBiocccsize(1)\fP.
