.SH NAME
chkentry_test.sh \- test chkentry on good and bad auth.json and info.json files
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBchkentry_test.sh\fP [\-h] [\-V] [\-v level] [\-D dbg_level] [\-J level] [\-q] [\-c chkentry] [\-d json_tree]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBchkentry_test.sh\fP tests each file in the \fItest_JSON/auth.json\fP and \fItest_JSON/info.json\fP subdirectories
It uses \fBfind(1)\fP to look under the JSON tree for good and bad files that must pass or fail respectively.
The files that must pass are in the subdirectory called \fIgood\fP and the files that must fail are in the subdirectory called \fIbad\fP.
It keeps a log of all the tests in \fIchkentry_test.log\fP for later inspection.

.SH FILES
\fIchkentry_test.log\fP
.RS
The log file kept by \fBchkentry_test.sh\fP.
It will be removed prior to each time the script is run to keep the state of the file consistent with the run.
.RE
\fItest_JSON\fP
.RS
The default JSON tree with good and bad subdirectories for files that must pass and fail, respectively.
.RE
.SH NOTES
The JSON parser \fBjparse(1)\fP and \fBchkentry(1)\fP were co\-developed by Cody Boone Ferguson and Landon Curt Noll (one of the IOCCC Judges) in support for IOCCCMOCK, IOCCC28 and beyond.
.SH BUGS
.PP
Currently some of the tests actually fail.
This appears to be because the test cases are actually bad.
This will be fixed in the near future.
