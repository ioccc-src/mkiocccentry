.SH NAME
jparse_test.sh \- test jparse on one or more files with one or more one\-line JSON blobs
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBjparse_test.sh\fP [\-h] [\-V] [\-v level] [\-D dbg_level] [\-J level] [\-q] [\-j jparse] [\-d json_tree] [file ..]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBjparse_test.sh\fP tests each line in each file for valid JSON.
The file name \fI\-\fP means read from stdin.
At least one file is required.
It also uses \fBfind(1)\fP to look under the JSON tree for good and bad files that must pass or fail respectively.
The files that must pass are in the subdirectory called \fIgood\fP and the files that must fail are in the subdirectory called \fIbad\fP.
It keeps a log of all the tests in \fIjparse_test.log\fP for later inspection.
