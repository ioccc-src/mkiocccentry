.SH NOTES
.PP
This script is only needed when a version of a tool is changed by a developer of the repo.
.PP
The tool \fBsed(1)\fP and various others could also be used to do this but this script is generally preferred because it can verify that the version change is actually correct.
.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
.nf
After changing the version of \fBtxzchk\fP to \fB0.12 2022\-09\-2\fP from \fB0.11 2022\-08\-23\fP show what files would change:
.RS
\fB
 ./vermod.sh \-l \-n '0.11 2022\-08\-23' '0.12 2022\-09\-22'\fP
.RE
.PP
.nf
After verifying that the above command is correct, run the script again to actually make the changes:
.RS
\fB
 ./vermod.sh  '0.11 2022\-08\-23' '0.12 2022\-09\-22'\fP
