.SH NAME
mkiocccentry \- make an IOCCC compressed tarball for an IOCCC entry
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBmkiocccentry [\-h] [\-v level] [\-V] [\-t tar] [\-c cp] [\-l ls] [\-C txzchk] [\-F fnamchk] [{\-a|\-A|\-i} answers] [\-W] work_dir prog.c Makefile remarks.md [file ...]\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBmkiocccentry\fP gathers your source file, Makefile, remarks as well as any other files and creates a XZ compressed tarball.
The tool runs \fBiocccsize\fP and it also runs a test on the Makefile to verify that everything seems in order.
You can ignore the warnings except that the Makefile cannot be empty.
The work_dir is a directory that the program will copy the files to (under a subdirectory based on the title of the entry and the entry number), to create the tarball.
If the work_dir already exists the program will tell you to move it or delete it.
The program does \fBNOT\fP delete it in case you wish to inspect that everything is okay or do any other tests; it does however show you how you can delete it should you wish to.
