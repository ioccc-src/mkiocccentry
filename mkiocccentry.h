 * mkiocccentry - form IOCCC entry compressed tarball
 *
 * "Because even printf has a return value worth paying attention to." :-)
 *
 * Make an IOCCC compressed tarball for an IOCCC submission.
 *
 * We will form the IOCCC entry compressed tarball "by hand" in C.
 * Not in some high level language, but standard vanilla (with a healthy
 * overdose of chocolate :-) ) C.  Why?  Because this is an obfuscated C
 * contest.  But then why isn't this code obfuscated?  Because the IOCCC judges
 * prefer to write in robust unobfuscated code.  Besides, the IOCCC was started
 * as an ironic commentary on the Bourne shell source and finger daemon source.
 * Moreover, irony is well baked-in to the IOCCC.  :-)
 *
 * OK, we do make use of shell scripts to help build and test
 * this repo: but who doesn't use a bit of shell scripting now and then?  :-)
 * Nevertheless, the core of building your IOCCC entry compressed tarball,
 * the code that you, the IOCCC contestant will use, is all written in
 * C because this is the IOCCC.
 *
 * If you do find a problem with this code, please let the us know by opening an
 * issue at the GitHub issues page:
 *
 *      https://github.com/ioccc-src/mkiocccentry/issues
 *
 * Many thanks are due to a number of people who provided important
 * and valuable testing, suggestions, issue reports and GitHub pull
 * requests to this code.  Without their time and effort, this tool
 * would not work very well!
