# Major changes to the IOCCC entry toolkit


## Release 1.0.0 2025-09-19

Initial release of `pr.c`, `pr.h`, and  `Makefile`.

Code has been copied over from [mkiocccentry
repo](https://github.com/ioccc-src/mkiocccentry) and from the [jparse
repo](https://github.com/xexyl/jparse).

The code in this from repo was copied out of the [mkiocccentry toolkit
repo](https://github.com/ioccc-src/mkiocccentry) and out of the  [jparse
repo](https://github.com/xexyl/jparse).

The origin of libpr dates back to code written by Landon Curt Noll
around 2008.  That 2008 code was copied into the jparse repo, and the
mkiocccentry toolkit repo by Landon Curt Noll.  While in the jparse repo,
both Landon Curt Noll and Cody Boone Ferguson added to and improved this
code base.
