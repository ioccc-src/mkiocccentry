Only run this script when you wish to invalidate all timestamps prior to now, such as when you make a fundamental change to a critical JSON format, or make a fundamental change to the compressed tarball file structure, or make a critical change to limit_ioccc.h that is MORE restrictive.
.PP
\fBDO NOT\fP run this script simply for a new IOCCC!
.PP
Yes, we make it very hard to run this script for good reason.
Only IOCCC judges can perform ALL the steps needed to complete this action.
