# reset_tstamp.sh - reset the minimum timestamp: MIN_TIMESTAMP
#
# Only run this script when you wish to invalidate all timestamps prior to now,
# such as when you make a fundamental change to a critical JSON format, or make
# a fundamental change to the compressed tarball file structure, or make a
# critical change to limit_ioccc.h that is MORE restrictive.
#
# DO NOT run this script simply for a new IOCCC!
#
# Yes, we make it very hard to run this script for good reason.  Only IOCCC
# judges can perform ALL the steps needed to complete this action.
