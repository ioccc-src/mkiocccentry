.SH NAME
run_bison.sh \- run
.B bison
to generate C code from a
.I *.y
file or use backup files if error
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBrun_bison.sh\fP [\-h] [\-V] [\-v level] [\-o] [\-b bison] [\-l limit_ioccc.sh] [\-g verge] [\-p prefix] [\-s sorry.h] [\-S] [\-B dir] \-\- [bison_flags]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBrun_bison.sh\fP attempts to find a recent enough version of
.B bison
(minimum version defined in \fIlimit_ioccc.sh\fP or file specified by \fB\-l\fP option) and use it to generate code from the \fBprefix.y\fP file.
The default prefix is \fIjparse\fP but this script can be used for other parsers as well.
If a recent enough version is not found or
.B bison
encounters an error (syntax error or anything else) and the \fB\-o\fP option is not specified, it attempts to use the backup files \fIprefix.tab.ref.c\fP and \fIprefix.tab.ref.h\fP.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-h\fP
Show help and exit.
.TP
\fB\-V\fP
Show version and exit.
.TP
\fB\-v \fIlevel\fP\fP
Set verbosity level to \fIlevel\fP.
.TP
\fB\-o\fP
Do \fBNOT\fP use backup files.
If
.B bison
cannot be used or fails to generate the files the script will fail.
.TP
\fB\-b \fIbison\fP\fP
Set
.B bison
basename to \fIbison\fP.
.TP
\fB\-l \fIlimit_ioccc.sh\fP\fP
Set path of version file to \fIlimit_ioccc.sh\fP.
.TP
\fB\-g \fIverge\fP\fP
Set path to the \fBverge\fP tool to \fIverge\fP.
This is used to determine if the
.B bison
tool is recent enough.
.TP
\fB\-p \fIprefix\fP\fP
Set prefix of files to use to \fIprefix\fP.
The bison input file will be \fIprefix.y\fP.
If the \fB\-o\fP option was not used and bison cannot be used or fails then the backup file
.I prefix.tab.ref.c
and
.I prefix.tab.ref.h
will be used.
.TP
\fB\-s \fIsorry.h\fP\fP
Set path of file to prepend to the C output to \fIsorry.h\fP.
.TP
\fB\-S\fP
Suppress prepending apology to generated C output files.
.TP
\fB\-B \fIbison_dir\fP\fP
Add a directory to search for
.B bison
in to \fIbison_dir\fP.
.B \-B
can be used more than once.
If not used the script looks at \fB$PATH\fP.
.PP
The \fBbison_flags\fP are any optional flags to give to bison before the prefix.
.SH EXIT STATUS

.SH NOTES
.PP
The \fB\-o\fP option is mainly for maintainers of the
.B jparse
parser and scanner but it can be used to test if you have a recent enough version of \fBbison\fP.
The idea behind it is if
.B bison
fails it might indicate a syntax error which the authors of
.B jparse
would need to fix.
.PP
Beware that some make implementations have a default rule for \fI*.y\fP files so that if one were to in this repo do:
.nf
.RS
\fB
 touch foo.y
 make\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
there would be an error in using make.
Even worse is that until that file is deleted (assuming \fIfoo.y\fP is in error say because it was created by touch and is empty) make will continue to fail.
This appears to be because foo is actually referenced in the Makefile as a target.
.SH BUGS
.PP
If you have any issues with the tool you can open an issue at
.br

.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
Run \fBrun_bison.sh\fP with default options, which should attempt to run
.B bison
on the \fIjparse.y\fP file:
.nf
.RS
\fB
 ./run_bison.sh\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
Run \fBrun_bison.sh\fP but specify that backup files are not to be used in case a recent enough version of
.B bison
cannot be found or fails for some reason.

.nf
.RS
\fB
 ./run_bison.sh \-o\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
Try and run
.B bison
on the file \fIfoobar.y\fP and don't use any backup files:
.nf
.RS
\fB
 ./run_bison.sh \-o \-p foobar\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
Try and run
.B bison
on the file \fIfoobar.y\fP with yacc instead of
.B bison
and don't use any backup files:
.nf
.RS
\fB
 ./run_bison.sh \-o \-p foobar \-b yacc\fP
.fi
