.SH NAME
run_flex.sh \- run
.B flex
to generate C code from a
.I *.l
file or use backup files if error
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBrun_flex.sh\fP [\-h] [\-V] [\-v level] [\-o] [\-f flex] [\-l limit_ioccc.sh] [\-g verge] [\-p prefix] [\-s sorry.h] [\-F dir] \-\- [flex_flags]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBrun_flex.sh\fP attempts to find a recent enough version of
.B flex
(minimum version defined in \fIlimit_ioccc.sh\fP or file specified by \fB\-l\fP option) and use it to generate code from the \fBprefix.l\fP file.
The default prefix is \fIjparse\fP but this script can be used for other scanners as well.
If a recent enough version is not found or
.B flex
encounters an error (syntax error or anything else) and the \fB\-o\fP option is not specified, it attempts to use the backup files.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-h\fP
Show help and exit.
.TP
\fB\-V\fP
Show version and exit.
.TP
\fB\-v \fIlevel\fP\fP
Set verbosity level to \fIlevel\fP.
.TP
\fB\-o\fP
Do \fBNOT\fP use backup files.
If
.B flex
cannot be used or fails to generate the files the script will fail.
.TP
\fB\-f \fIflex\fP\fP
Set
.B flex
basename to \fIflex\fP.
.TP
\fB\-l \fIlimit_ioccc.sh\fP\fP
Set path of version file to \fIlimit_ioccc.sh\fP.
.TP
\fB\-g \fIverge\fP\fP
Set path to the \fBverge\fP tool to \fIverge\fP.
This is used to determine if the
.B flex
tool is recent enough.
.TP
\fB\-p \fIprefix\fP\fP
Set prefix of files to use to \fIprefix\fP.
The
.B flex
input file will be \fIprefix.l\fP.
If the \fB\-o\fP option was not used and
.B flex
cannot be used or fails then the backup file
.I prefix.c
will be used.
.TP
\fB\-s \fIsorry.h\fP\fP
Set path to file to prepend to the C output to \fIsorry.h\fP.
.TP
\fB\-F \fIflex_dir\fP\fP
Add a directory to search for
.B flex
in to \fIflex_dir\fP.
\fB\-F\fP can be used more than once.
If not used the script looks at \fB$PATH\fP.
.PP
The
.B flex_flags
are any optional flags to give to
.B flex
before the prefix.

.SH NOTES
.PP
The \fB\-o\fP option is mainly for maintainers of the \fBjparse\fP scanner and parser but it can be used to test if you have a recent enough version of \fBflex\fP.
The idea behind it is if
.B flex
fails it might indicate a syntax error which the authors of \fBjparse\fP would need to fix.
.PP
Beware that some make implementations have a default rule for \fI*.l\fP files so that if one were to in this repo do:
.nf
.RS
\fB
 touch foo.l
 make\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
the file \fIfoo.c\fP would be overwritten and cause a compilation error.
This appears to be because foo is actually referenced in the Makefile as a target.
.SH BUGS
.PP
There's no way to disable prepending a file to the generated files.
This should probably be fixed at some point.
.PP
If you have any issues with the tool you can open an issue at
.br
\fI\<https://github.com/ioccc-src/mkiocccentry/issues\>\fP.
.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
Run \fBrun_flex.sh\fP with default options, which should attempt to run
.B flex
on the \fIjparse.l\fP file:
.nf
.RS
\fB
 ./run_flex.sh\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
Run \fBrun_flex.sh\fP but specify that backup files are not to be used in case a recent enough version of
.B flex
cannot be found or fails for some reason.

.nf
.RS
\fB
 ./run_flex.sh -o\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
Try and run
.B flex
on the file \fIfoobar.l\fP and don't use any backup files:
.nf
.RS
\fB
 ./run_flex.sh -o -p foobar\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
Try and run
.B flex
on the file \fIfoobar.l\fP with lex instead of
.B flex
and don't use any backup files:
.nf
.RS
\fB
 ./run_flex.sh -o -p foobar -f lex\fP
.fi
