/*
 * A programmer's apology and warning
 *
 * Sorry (tm Canada :-)) for the appalling condition of the code below.
 *
 * The people who worked on this repo did NOT write his code.  Well,
 * OK, we DID write this comment.  We refer to code beyond this comment.
 * The code below was generated by the bison or flex code generators.
 *
 * WARNING: We do NOT recommend that you modify the generated code
 * even though it is digitally odoriferous and has a gleet-like
 * appearance.  Beautification of this code, no matter how disagreeable
 * it may seem, is unwise as such modifications tend to be practically
 * impossible to maintain.  Even if this Flying Spaghetti Monster
 * style code tempts you to tweak it, doing do might produce visions
 * of Cthulhu-like tentacles grabbing at the very logic of your mind,
 * pulling it down into a hideous maelstrom of code maintenance cacophony.
 *
 * OK, it might not give you digital nightmares but why take the risk?
 * The point is don't work on this file! Instead work on the bison and
 * flex related source files.  See the Makefile for details on how this
 * file was generated.
 *
 * Some might be tempted to point out this code is in support of the
 * International Obfuscated C Code Contest (IOCCC) and that objecting
 * to the output of Bison and Flex borders on programming sanctimoniousness.
 * At first glance, this incongruence is unsustainable.  In response
 * we opine that one of the fundamental undertones of the IOCCC are
 * the promotion of good programming through the irony awarding highly
 * obfuscated C code.  So, if it helps, we suggest you view this apology
 * in a satirical light, even if you are humour impaired.  Nevertheless,
 * we still recommend you to eschew modifying the code below.
 *
 * Thanks in advance for your understanding, and sorry (tm Canada :-)).
 *
 * P.S. In 2022 April 04, when this comment was initially formed, none of the
 *	people	working on this repo were Canadian.  But some of them have
 *	several	good friends who live in, or are from Canada.  Those friends
 *	say sorry in a fun and friendly way, so we honour those friends
 *	accordingly.
