/*
 * default_handle - translate UTF-8 into handle that is POSIX portable and + chars
 *
 * "Because even POSIX needs an extra plus." :-)
 *
 * An author_handle, if the submission is selected by the
 * IOCCC judges to win the IOCCC, will be used to form a
 * JSON filename under the author directory on the IOCCC
 * website.  For this and other reasons, we must restrict an
 * author_handle to use only POSIX portable filenames, and we
 * must restrict the leading character to be ASCII alphabetic,
 * in addition to other character restrictions.
 *
 * The author_handle must fit the following regular expression:
 *
 *	^[0-9A-Za-z][0-9A-Za-z._+-]*$
