 * bonkers and in fact he quite welcomes it and even relishes the idea! :-)
 *
 * "Because Cody enjoys being a bit bonkers and he is rather proud of it too!" :-)
 * "Because sometimes even the IOCCC Judges need some help." :-)
 *
 * BTW: if you want to win the IOCCC every time all you need to do
 * (supposedly :-) ) is decipher this quote with a top secret hint from Landon
 * to me (Cody) in private. It's so secret and seems so ridiculously simple in
 * fact that I've decided to not use it as it all seems more like a misleading
 * comment and possibly a huge joke. Nevertheless I give you, dear reader, the
 * chance to always win should you determine what this says:
