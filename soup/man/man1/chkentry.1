.SH DESCRIPTION
.B chkentry is primarily used by other tools (not humans).
.PP
Validates the
.I .info.json
and/or
.I .auth.json
of an IOCCC entry.
In the two argument form,
.I info.JSON
is the path of an IOCCC entry information JSON file, and
.I auth.JSON
is the path of an IOCCC entry author JSON file.
If
.B info.JSON
is
.I .
(dot), then this file is ignored.
If
.B auth.JSON
is
.I .
(dot), then this file is ignored.
In the one argument form,
.B entry_dir
is assumed to be a directory containing both
.I .info.json
and
.I .auth.json
files.
The one argument form is equivalent to calling the command with two arguments:
.I entry_dir/.info.json
and
.IR entry_dir/.auth.json .
.PP
As a sanity check, the
.BR mkiocccentry (1)
program executes
.B chkentry
AFTER both the
.I .info.json
and
.I .auth.json
files have been created and before the compressed tarball is formed.
If
.B mkiocccentry
sees a 0 exit status, then all is well.
For a non\-zero exit code, the tool aborts because any problems detected by
.B chkentry
based on what
.B mkiocccentry
wrote into
.I .info.json
and/or
.I .auth.json
indicates there is a serious mismatch between what
.B mkiocccentry
is doing and what
.B chkentry
expects.
.PP
