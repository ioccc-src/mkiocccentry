.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR chkentry (1)
runs a number of validation checks on an IOCCC submission or winning entry directory.
Depending on the options, it will validate the
.B .auth.json
and/or
.B .info.json
files, as well as checking the permissions of files and directories (unless the
.B \-P
option is used) and, if the
.B .info.json
file is not ignored, it will compare the manifest with the files in the directory, unless that file has been explicitly ignored with the
.BI \-i\  subpath
option.
In winning entry mode (the
.B \-w
option), some files must exist whereas others may not exist, depending on the
.BI \-i\  subpath
option; otherwise, without
.BR \-w ,
a different set of files must exist and must not exist, again depending on the
.BI \-i\  subpath
option.
.PP
In either case, even if the manifest is being ignored, it will verify that the files in the directories are valid permissions (again, unless it's an ignored subpath or the
.B \-P
option is used), whether specific files are missing (unless it was ignored) and if specific files in the directory are not, by name, allowed (unless it was ignored).
It will also verify that the filenames are sane, relative paths, in the context of the IOCCC rules, at least when not in winning entry mode and if not ignored.
.PP
As a sanity check, the
.BR mkiocccentry (1)
program executes
.B chkentry
after forming the
.B .auth.json
and
.BR .info.json ,
in order to test that everything is in order.
If
.BR mkiocccentry (1)
sees a 0 exit status, then all is well.
For a non\-zero exit code, the tool aborts because any problems detected by
.BR chkentry (1)
based on what
.BR mkiocccentry (1)
did indicates there is a serious mismatch between what
.BR mkiocccentry (1)
is doing and what
.BR chkentry (1)
expects.
.PP
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-h
Print help and exit.
.TP
.BI \-v\  level
Set verbosity level to
.I level
(def: 0).
.TP
.BI \-J\  level
Set JSON parser verbosity to
.I level
(def: 0).
.TP
.B \-V
Print version and exit.
.TP
.B \-q
Set quiet mode.
Silences msg(), warn(), warnp() if verbosity level is 0.
.TP
.BI \-i\  subpath
Ignore
.IR subpath ,
where
.I subpath
is under the
.I directory
to be checked.
.PP
This option may be used more than once but is only meant for the judges.
.TP
.BI \-P

This option is for the judges.
.TP
.B \-w
Perform winning entry tests instead of submission tests.
This option is for the judges.
.SH EXIT STATUS
.TP
0
all OK
.TQ
1
a JSON file is not valid JSON, a semantics test failed or some other test failed
.TQ
2
.B \-h
and help string printed or
.B \-V
and version string printed
.TQ
3
command line error
.TQ
>=10
internal error
.SH NOTES
.PP
.BR chkentry (1)
is primarily used by other tools (not humans) but you may wish to test your submission directory manually if you're trying something clever.
It would be a good idea to note why you think it's clever.
.PP
Note that if you are testing that your submission directory is valid, you should
.B NOT
use either the
.B \-w
or
.BI \-i\  subpath
option as these exist for the judges only and not when validating the directory is a valid submission directory.
.SH BUGS
.PP
More than 0 humans work on it! :)
.PP
The IOCCC uses the term
.B entry
to refer to a submission that won the IOCCC whereas the term
.B submission
is used to refer to something given to the IOCCC judges for consideration when the IOCCC is open.
If the IOCCC was being consistent, then
.BR chkentry (1)
and the
.BR mkiocccentry (1)
tools would not have "entry" in their names.
On the other hand, if the names of those tools were named in a consistent fashion, they would have been named
.B chksubmission
and
.B mkiocccsubmission
respectively, which is a bit too long for a tool name, and it would have ruined the
.B mkiocccentry
pun.
The IOCCC decided to
.B NOT rename the tools
in the name of
.BR fputs (3)
backward compatibility. :)
.PP
As a compromise, the name of the compressed tarball produced by
.BR mkiocccentry (1)
was changed to start with
.I submit
instead of
.IR entry .
The
.BR fnamchk (1)
tool was by necessity changed accordingly.
.PP
Astute proof readers might find circumstances where variables, comments, error messages and prompt strings use
.B entry
instead of
.BR submission .
You are welcome to submit pull requests to
.I https://github.com/ioccc-src/mkiocccentry/pulls
correct such oversights in variables,
comments, error messages and prompt strings.
Note, however, that there are many cases where the words
.B entry
and
.B entries
are actually correct: they would only be incorrect if they refer to an IOCCC submission that has not won.
In other words if it refers to submissions won then it should be
.B entry
or
.BR entries .
.PP
If you have an issue with the tool you can open an issue at
