.I auth.json
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Validates the
.I .info.json
and/or
.I .auth.json
of an IOCCC entry.
In the two argument form,
.I info.JSON
is the path of an IOCCC entry information JSON file, and
.I auth.JSON
is the path of an IOCCC entry author JSON file.
If
.B info.JSON
is
.I .
(dot), then this file is ignored.
If
.B auth.JSON
is
.I .
(dot), then this file is ignored.
In the one argument form,
.I submission_dir
is assumed to be a directory containing both
.I .info.json
and
.I .auth.json
files.
The one argument form is equivalent to calling the command with two arguments:
.I submission_dir/.info.json
and
.IR submission_dir/.auth.json .
.PP
As a sanity check, the
.BR mkiocccentry (1)
program executes
.B chkentry
after the
.I .info.json
and
.I .auth.json
files have been created, once per file, testing that everything is well.
If
.BR mkiocccentry (1)
sees a 0 exit status, then all is well.
For a non\-zero exit code, the tool aborts because any problems detected by
.B chkentry
based on what
.BR mkiocccentry (1)
wrote into
.I .info.json
and/or
.I .auth.json
indicates there is a serious mismatch between what
.BR mkiocccentry (1)
is doing and what
.B chkentry
expects.
.PP
.SH OPTIONS

.SH EXIT STATUS

file(s) not valid JSON and no semantic checks were performed
.TQ

internal error
.SH NOTES
.B chkentry
is primarily used by other tools (not humans) but you may wish to test your entry JSON files manually if you're trying something clever.
It would be a good idea to note why you think it's clever.
.SH BUGS
.PP
More than 0 humans work on it! :)
.PP
The IOCCC uses the term
.B entry
to refer to submission that won the IOCCC
whereas the term
.B submission
is used to refer to something given to the IOCCC judges for consideration when the IOCCC is open.
If the IOCCC was being consistent, then
.BR chkentry (1)
and the
.BR mkiocccentry (1)
tools would not have "entry" in their names.
On the other hand, if the names of those tools were named
in a consistent fashion, they would have been named
.B chksubmission
and
.B mkiocccsubmission
respectively, which is a bit too long for a tool name,
and it would have runed the
.B mkiocccentry
pun.
The IOCCC decided to
.B NOT rename the tools
in the name of
.BR fputs (3)
backward compatibility. :)
.PP
As a compromise, the name of the compressed tarball produced by
.BR mkiocccentry (1)
was changed to start with
.I submit
instead.
The
.BR fnamchk (1)
tool was changed accordingly.
.PP
Astute proof readers will find circumstances where variables,
comments, error messages and prompt strings use
.B entry
instead of
.BR submission .
You are welcome to submit pull requests to
.I https://github.com/ioccc-src/mkiocccentry/pulls
correct such oversights in variables,
comments, error messages and prompt strings.
.PP
If you have an issue with the tool you can open an issue at
.br
.IR https://github.com/ioccc\-src/mkiocccentry/issues\> .
