.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR chkentry (1)
runs a number of validation checks on
.B dir
which is either a IOCCC submission
.I topdir
directory, or winning IOCCC entry directory.
.PP
If
.I dir
is an IOCCC submission
.I topdir
directory, then
.B .auth.json
and/or
.B .info.json
files, as well as checking the permissions of files and directories (unless the
.B \-P
option is used) and, if the
.B .info.json
file is not ignored, it will compare the manifest with the files in the
.B dir
directory,
unless that file has been explicitly ignored with the
.BI \-i\  subpath
option.
.PP
If
.I dir
is a winning IOCCC entry directory, then the
.B \-w
option, must be given.
Some files must exist whereas others may not exist, depending on the
.BI \-i\  subpath
option; otherwise, without
.BR \-w ,
a different set of files must exist and must not exist, again depending on the
.BI \-i\  subpath
option.
.PP
In either case, even if the manifest is being ignored, it will verify that the files in the directories are valid permissions (again, unless it's an ignored subpath or the
.B \-P
option is used), whether specific files are missing (unless it was ignored) and if specific files in the directory are not, by name, allowed (unless it was ignored).
It will also verify that the filenames are sane, relative paths, in the context of the IOCCC rules, at least when not in winning entry mode and if not ignored.
.PP
As a sanity check, the
.BR mkiocccentry (1)
program executes
.BR chkentry \-S
after forming the
.B .auth.json
and
.BR .info.json ,
in order to test that everything is in order.
If
.BR mkiocccentry (1)
sees a 0 exit status, then all is well.
For a non\-zero exit code, the tool aborts because any problems detected by
.BR chkentry (1)
based on what
.BR mkiocccentry (1)
did indicates there is a serious mismatch between what
.BR mkiocccentry (1)
is doing and what
.BR chkentry (1)
expects.
.PP
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-h
Print help and exit.
.TP
.BI \-v\  level
Set verbosity level to
.I level
(def: 0).
.TP
.BI \-J\  level
Set JSON parser verbosity to
.I level
(def: 0).
.TP
.B \-V
Print version and exit.
.TP
.B \-q
Set quiet mode.
Silences msg(), warn(), warnp() if verbosity level is 0.
.TP
.BI \-i\  subpath
Ignore
.IR subpath ,
where
.I subpath
is a path relative to the
.B dir
directory.
.sp 1
This option may be used more than once but is only meant for the judges.
Anyone who's not a judge might have their submission ignored instead. :\-)
.TP
.BI \-P
Ignore permissions of files and directories.
This option is for the judges.
Use of this option by someone other than a judge might make them lose consciousness :\-)
.TP
.BI \-s
Enter special mode.
This is for the judges only.
Use of this option by someone other than a judge might make them lose the next IOCCC :\-)
.TP
.BI \-S
Submission mode.
This is used by
.BR chkentry (1).
.TP
.B \-w
Perform winning entry tests instead of submission tests.
This option is for the judges.
.SH EXIT STATUS
.TP
0
all OK
.TQ
1
some check failed, invalid JSON, semantic test failure, or other test failure
.TQ
2
.B \-h
and help string printed or
.B \-V
and version string printed
.TQ
3
command line error
.TQ
>=10
internal error
.SH NOTES
.PP
.BR chkentry (1)
is primarily used by other tools (not humans) but you may wish to test your submission directory manually if you're trying something clever.
It would be a good idea to note why you think it's clever.
.PP
Note that if you are testing that your submission directory is valid, you should
.B NOT
use either the
.B \-w
or
.BI \-i\  subpath
option as these exist for the judges only and not when validating the directory is a valid submission directory.
.SH BUGS
.PP
More than 0 humans work on it! :)
.PP
The IOCCC uses the term
.B entry
to refer to a submission that won the IOCCC whereas the term
.B submission
is used to refer to something given to the IOCCC judges for consideration when the IOCCC is open.
Nevertheless, this tool is able to perform checks in a submission when the
.B \-S
option is used.
.PP
The
.BR chksubmit (1)
tool calls this tool with the
.B \-S
option in order to perform important validation checks on a submission.
.PP
Astute proof readers might find circumstances where variables, comments, error messages and prompt strings use
.B entry
instead of
.BR submission .
You are welcome to submit pull requests to
.I https://github.com/ioccc-src/mkiocccentry/pulls
correct such oversights in variables,
comments, error messages and prompt strings.
Note, however, that there are many cases where the words
.B entry
and
.B entries
are actually correct: they would only be incorrect if they refer to an IOCCC submission that has not won.
In other words if it refers to submissions won then it should be
.B entry
or
.BR entries .
.SH BUGS
.PP
While the humans maintaining this code use a test suite to validate this code,
and no so-called AI tool contributed to this tool's codebase,
this tool's test suite was written by humans with the best of intentions. :)
.PP
While of this tool does not guarantee that your submission will win the IOCCC,
submitting something that fails to pass the important validation checks
.B will guarantee
that your submission will be
.BR rejected .
