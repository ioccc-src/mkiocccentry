.SH NAME
iocccsize \- IOCCC Source Size Tool
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBiocccsize\fP [\-h] [\-i] [\-v level] [\-q] [\-V] prog.c
.br
\fBiocccsize\fP [\-h] [\-i] [\-v level] [\-q] [\-V] < prog.c
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Reading a C source file from standard input or a file arg, apply the IOCCC source size rules as explained in the Guidelines.
.PP
The source's Rule 2b length is written to stdout; with \-v option the Rule 2b length, gross (Rule 2a) length, and matched keyword count are written to stdout.
.PP
The size tool counts most C reserved words (keyword, secondary, and selected preprocessor keywords) as 1.
The size tool counts all other octets as 1 excluding ASCII whitespace, and excluding any ';', '{' or '}' followed by ASCII whitespace, and excluding any ';', '{' or '}' octet immediately before the end of file.

Quiet mode.
Silence msg(), warn(), warnp() if verbosity level is 0.
.TP
\fB\-V\fP
Show version and exit.
.SH EXIT STATUS

source code is within Rule 2a and Rule 2b limits
.TQ
1
source code larger than Rule 2a and/or Rule 2b limits
.TQ

3
\-V used and version printed
.TQ

.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
.nf
Test if prog.c fits within Rule 2b and Rule 2b limits, reporting if there's a problem.
Output the Rule 2b value for prog.c:
.RS
\fB
 ./iocccsize < prog.c
 ./iocccsize prog.c\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
.nf
Test if prog.c fits within Rule 2b and Rule 2b limits, reporting if there's a problem.
Output the Rule 2b length, gross (Rule 2a) length, and matched keyword count:
.RS
\fB
 ./iocccsize \-v 1 < prog.c
 ./iocccsize \-v 1 prog.c\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
.nf
You may also wish to try the test script in verbose mode:
.RS
\fB
 ./iocccsize_test.sh \-v 3\fP
.fi
.RE

.SH BUGS
.PP
There are no bugs, only features! :\-)
.PP
The matched keyword count is currently ignored by the IOCCC.
.PP
Because the original source was an IOCCC winner,
"You are not expected to understand this" applies to somewhat improved source code. :\-)
.PP
