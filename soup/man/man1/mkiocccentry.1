.SH NAME
.B mkiocccentry
\- make an IOCCC compressed tarball for an IOCCC entry
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B mkiocccentry
.RB [\| options \|]
.I work_dir
.I prog.c
.I Makefile
.I remarks.md
.RI [\| file
.IR ... \|]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B mkiocccentry
gathers your source file, Makefile, remarks as well as any other files and creates an XZ compressed tarball.
The tool runs
.B iocccsize
on your
.I prog.c
and it also runs tests on the
.IR Makefile \|,
the
.IR remarks.md
and any extra files as well to verify that everything seems in order.
You can ignore the warnings except that the
.I Makefile
cannot be empty.
.PP
Under the
.I work_dir
.B mkiocccentry
will create an entry directory (based on the IOCCC contestant ID and entry number) that the program will copy the files to in order to create the tarball.
If the entry directory already exists the program will tell you to move it or delete it.
The program does
.B NOT
delete it for you.
.PP
Before forming the tarball,
.B mkiocccentry
will ask you for information about your entry including the number of authors and various information about the author(s).
Once all the information has been collected it will copy the files to the entry directory under the
.IR work_dir \|.
At this point it will create the
.I .info.json
and
.I .auth.json 
files with information about the entry and information about the authors (which is for winning entries).
.PP
After each file is formed it will run
.BR chkentry (1)
on the file. If
.BR chkentry (1)
exits with non\-zero
.B mkiocccentry
will abort because any problems detected by
.BR chkentry (1)
based on what
.B mkiocccentry
wrote indicates that there is a serious mismatch between what
.B mkiocccentry
is doing and what
.BR chkentry (1)
expects.
.PP
After forming the tarball
.BR txzchk (1)
is run which verifies that the tarball is okay (\c
.BR txzchk (1)
in turn will call
.BR fnamchk (1)\c
\&).
.PP
Because some might want or need to update an entry there is functionality to write your answers to a file so that you can feed the program the answers quickly.

.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
Run test script:
.sp
.RS
.ft B
 ./mkiocccentry_test.sh
.ft R
.RE
.PP
Make
.I work_dir
and then make an entry from the files
.IR prog.c ,
.I Makefile
and
.IR remarks.md ,
saving your answers to the file
.I answers
for future updates:
.sp
.RS
.ft B
 mkdir work_dir
 ./mkiocccentry \-a answers work_dir prog.c Makefile remarks.md
.ft R
.RE
.PP
Use the answers file from the previous invocation to quickly update the entry with an additional file added:
.sp
.RS
.ft B
 ./mkiocccentry \-i answers work_dir prog.c Makefile remarks.md data.txt
.ft R
.RE
.PP
Run program, specifying alternative path to
.B tar
and
.BR txzchk :
.sp
.RS
.ft B
 ./mkiocccentry \-t /path/to/tar \-T /path/to/txzchk
.ft R
