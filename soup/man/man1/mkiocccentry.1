.SH NAME
.B mkiocccentry
\- make an IOCCC compressed tarball for an IOCCC entry
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B mkiocccentry
.RB [\| options \|]
.I work_dir
.I prog.c
.I Makefile
.I remarks.md
.RI [\| \[ file | directory \]
.IR ... \|]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B mkiocccentry
gathers your source file, Makefile and remarks as well as any other files and/or directories, and creates an XZ compressed tarball, assuming input is correct and everything is valid.
The tool runs
.B iocccsize
on your
.I prog.c
and it also runs tests on the
.IR Makefile \|,
the
.IR remarks.md
and any extra files as well to verify that everything seems in order.
You can ignore certain warnings but some warnings cannot be disabled; the program will let you know more about errors and you can correct them in that case.
.PP
Under the
.I work_dir
.B mkiocccentry
will create an entry directory (based on the IOCCC contestant ID and entry number) that the program will copy the files to in order to create the tarball.
One may pass in a directory name and the directory and everything under it will be copied to the work directory; however the filename restrictions still apply and there is a limit on the depth you may use, and if the filenames are not valid or the depth is higher than the max depth, it is an error.
If the entry directory already exists the program will tell you to move it or delete it.
The program does
.B NOT
delete it for you.
.PP
Before forming the tarball,
.B mkiocccentry
will ask you for information about your entry including the number of authors and various information about the author(s).
Once all the information has been collected it will copy the files to the entry directory under the
.IR work_dir \|.
At this point it will create the
.I .info.json
and
.I .auth.json
files with information about the entry and information about the authors (which is for winning entries).
.PP
After each file is formed it will run
.BR chkentry (1)
on the file. If
.BR chkentry (1)
exits with non\-zero
.B mkiocccentry
will abort because any problems detected by
.BR chkentry (1)
based on what
.B mkiocccentry
wrote indicates that there is a serious mismatch between what
.B mkiocccentry
is doing and what
.BR chkentry (1)
expects.
.PP
After forming the tarball
.BR txzchk (1)
is run which verifies that the tarball is okay (\c
.BR txzchk (1)
in turn will call
.BR fnamchk (1)\c
\&).
.PP
Because some might want or need to update an entry there is functionality to write your answers to a file so that you can feed the program the answers quickly.

.SH BUGS
.PP
More than 0 humans work on it! :)
.PP
The IOCCC uses the term
.B entry
to refer to a submission that won the IOCCC whereas the term
.B submission
is used to refer to something given to the IOCCC judges for consideration when the IOCCC is open.
If the IOCCC was being consistent, then
.BR chkentry (1)
and the
.BR mkiocccentry (1)
tools would not have "entry" in their names.
On the other hand, if the names of those tools were named in a consistent fashion, they would have been named
.B chksubmission
and
.B mkiocccsubmission
respectively, which is a bit too long for a tool name, and it would have ruined the
.B mkiocccentry
pun.
The IOCCC decided to
.B NOT rename the tools
in the name of
.BR fputs (3)
backward compatibility. :)
.PP
As a compromise, the name of the compressed tarball produced by
.BR mkiocccentry (1)
was changed to start with
.I submit
instead of
.IR entry .
The
.BR fnamchk (1)
tool was by necessity changed accordingly.
.PP
Astute proof readers might find circumstances where variables, comments, error messages and prompt strings use
.B entry
instead of
.BR submission .
You are welcome to submit pull requests to
.I https://github.com/ioccc-src/mkiocccentry/pulls
correct such oversights in variables,
comments, error messages and prompt strings.
Note, however, that there are many cases where the words
.B entry
and
.B entries
are actually correct: they would only be incorrect if they refer to an IOCCC submission that has not won.
In other words if it refers to submissions won then it should be
.B entry
or
.BR entries .
.PP
If you have an issue with the tool you can open an issue at
.br
.IR https://github.com/ioccc\-src/mkiocccentry/issues\> .
.SH EXAMPLES
