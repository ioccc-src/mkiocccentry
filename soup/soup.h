 *
 * The IOCCC soup is a joke between Landon and Cody after Cody misread, being
 * very tired at the time, one word as 'soup', when discussing decreasing the
 * number of files in the top level directory (thus the name of this directory).
 * We might have even left you all some delicious soup somewhere here. :-)
 *
 * Share and enjoy! :-)
