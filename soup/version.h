/*
 * version - official IOCCC toolkit versions
 *
 * Make an IOCCC compressed tarball for an IOCCC entry.
 *
 * We will form the IOCCC entry compressed tarball "by hand" in C.
 * Not in some high level language, but standard vanilla (with a healthy
 * overdose of chocolate :-) ) C.  Why? Because this is an obfuscated C contest.
 * But then why isn't this code obfuscated?  Because the IOCCC judges prefer to
 * write in robust unobfuscated code.  Besides, the IOCCC was started as an
 * ironic commentary on the Bourne shell source and finger daemon source.
 * Moreover, irony is well baked-in to the IOCCC.  :-)
 *
 * If you do find a problem with this code, please let the judges know.
 * To contact the judges please see:
 *
 *      https://www.ioccc.org/contact.html
 *
 * "Because even printf has a return value worth paying attention to." :-)
 *
 * Many thanks are due to a number of people who provided important
 * and valuable testing, suggestions, issue reports and GitHub pull
 * requests to this code.  Without their time and effort, this tool
 * would not work very well!
 *
 * Among the GitHub users we wish to thank include these fine developers
 * in alphabetical GitHub @user order:
 *
 *	@ilyakurdyukov		Ilya Kurdyukov
 *	@SirWumpus		Anthony Howe
 *	@vog			Volker Diels-Grabsch
