/*
 * walk_rule - rules for what to do when walking trees
 *
 * The p_preg element is only valid for a match of MATCH_REGEX,
 * MATCH_REGEX_ANYCASE, MATCH_EXT_REGEX, or MATCH_EXT_REGEX_ANYCASE. Such preg
 * values are initialized by regcomp(3) and later used by regexec(). In all
 * other match cases, p_preg is ignored.
 *
 * When initializing an array of walk_rules, the p_preg value may be initialized
 * to NULL. Before using an array of walk_rules, a walk_rule_setup() function
 * should be called so that any NULL p_preg may be replaced by a calls to
 * regcomp(&w->p_preg, w->pattern, cflags). For those pattern_type that do not
 * involve the regexec(3) facility, *p_preg should be set to NULL.
 *
 * In regards to cases where a fatal error is to be thrown, we recommend that
 * tools be able to report the problem on standard error AND exit non-zero AFTER
 * walking the tree. The choice of when to report the problem on standard error
 * is up to the tool implementation: right away or just before exiting non-zero.
 * A tool may wish to have mode to immediately print on stderr and exit non-zero
 * when first fatal error is thrown. The default (abort on first fatal error,
 * or collect all errors and report and exit after finishing the walk) is tool
 * implementation. You may wish to add a command line option to the tool to
 * switch to the non-default abort mode.
 *
 * When walking a tree and a walk_rule with ignore == true is matches for a
 * directory, ALL files under that ignored directory should be ignored. In
 * terms of fts(3) style tree walking, such an ignored directory may be used to
 * "prune" the tree walk, skipping over all paths under the ignored directory.
 *
 * When walking a tree and a walk_rule with ignore == true is matches for
 * non-directory such as a file, in terms of fts(3) style tree walking, it will
 * also be "pruned". Because the non-directory has nothing under it to "prune",
 * that action has no effect on the walk. Nevertheless the non-directory will be
 * indicated to the calling application as something to ignore. So there is
 * usefulness in declaring a file as something to ignore.
 *
 * When walking a tree and a walk_rule with prohibit == true is matches for a
 * directory, ALL files under that ignored directory should be ignored. In terms
 * of fts(3) style tree walking, such an ignored directory may be used to
 * "prune" the tree walk, skipping over all paths under the ignored directory.
 *
 * In the same way, when walking a tree and a walk_rule with ignore == true
 * matches for non-directory such as a file, it will also be "pruned". Because
 * the non-directory has nothing under it to "prune", that action has no effect
 * on the walk.
 *
 * NOTE: A pattern of "*" when the pattern_type is MATCH_FNMATCH or
 * MATCH_FNMATCH_ANYCASE will match an empty string path.
 *
 * The match_count value is to be incremented when a item matches, even if
 * ignore is true. For rules that are required, a match_count value 0 after
 * process all items is an error as it indicates that the required item is
 * missing.
 *
 * When initializing an array of walk_rules, the match_count values will be
 * initialized to 0.
 *
 * To match any item name, a pattern of "*" with a pattern_type of MATCH_ANY is
 * recommended.
 *
 * If pattern_type is TYPE_ANY, then the pattern is ignored. In this case
 * setting pattern to "*" is required.
 *
 * The idea behind any array of struct walk_rule is on a first match basis.
 * I.e., of a given item, the first struct walk_rule that applies of used. All
 * subsequent element in the struct walk_rule are ignored.
 *
 * Disallow problematic paths containing ".." (dot-dot):
 *
 * To avoid complications with path items containing ".." (dot-dot), use the
 * following early on in the struct walk_rule array to prohibit (and prune the
 * tree walk) such problematic paths:
 *
 *	{ "..",
 *	    false, false, false, false, true,
 *	    MATCH_STR, TYPE_ANY, LEVEL_ANY,
 *	    0, NULL },
 *
 * Suggested "catch all" walk_rules that may precede the final element of a
 * struct walk_rule array:
 *
 * To allow and count any file, use:
 *
 *	{ "*",
 *	   false, false, false, false, false,
 *	   MATCH_ANY, TYPE_FILE, LEVEL_ANY,
 *	   0, NULL },
 *
 * To allow and count any file or directory, use:
 *
 *	{ "*",
 *	   false, false, false, false, false,
 *	   MATCH_ANY, TYPE_FILEDIR, LEVEL_ANY,
 *	   0, NULL },
 *
 * To ignore anything else (i.e., item has no effect other than to prune the
         * tree walk), use:
 *
 *	{ "*",
 *	   false, false, true, false, false,
 *	   MATCH_ANY, TYPE_ANY, LEVEL_ANY,
 *	   0, NULL },
 *
 * To prohibit anything else (and to prune the tree walk), use:
 *
 *	{ "*",
 *	   false, false, false, false, true,
 *	   MATCH_ANY, TYPE_ANY, LEVEL_ANY,
 *	   0, NULL },
 *
 * Final element of a struct walk_rule array:
 *
 * An array of walk_rule structures MUST be terminated by a NULL pattern
 * walk_rule structure. When pattern is NULL, all other struct walk_rule are
 * ignored. To end an array of walk_rule structures, use:
 *
 *	{ NULL,
 *	   false, false, false, false, false,
 *	   MATCH_UNSET, TYPE_UNSET, LEVEL_UNSET,
 *	   0, NULL }
 *
 * When processing an item against an array of walk_rule structures and the
 * final NULL pattern is reached, the item will have no effect. To avoid this,
 * precede the final NULL pattern walk_rule with one of the above suggested
 * "catch all" walk_rule structures.

/*
 * walk_stat - record information and stats about a complete walk
 *
 * In all cases, the ready boolean is a gate.  If ready == false, then none of the other elements
 * of this structure are valid.  When ready == false, elements that are pointers may be NULL.
 *
 * The topdir may be am empty string when there is no identifiable topdir, such as what
 * might happen when "walking" a tarball listing.
 *
 * The many struct dyn_array pointers are intended to record walk information for a given item category.
 * These are in the form of paths relative topdir.  The "tell" macros may be used to determine the count,
 * i.e., the number of items that belonging to that given category.  In some cases the application may
 * wish to use a non-zero category as an indication of an error (such as prohibited items found) and
 * throw a fatal error if/as needed.
 *
 * The main "walk" functions record items in order that they were found.  No attempt is made
 * to prevent an item from being recorded multiple times.  The fts(3) traverse a file hierarchy,
 * if called properly with reasonable options, shouldn't produce duplicate items.  It is theoretically
 * possible that a damaged file system could produce duplicate items.
 *
 * Nevertheless the "walk" functions, when appending to a struct dyn_array for a given category, will not
 * attempt to de-duplicate.  It is worth noting that duplicate item circumstances should be very rare,
 * and or a sign that someone is "playing games" with data and deserve what they get.  So we recommend
 * letting not to worry about the very rare possibility of duplicate items and letting such cases be.
 *
 * The "qsort" functions may be used fast the walk to "order" the category paths.  The "walk" functions
 * do NOT sort items during the walk.  All application is free to provide a sort comparison function
 * to the walk_qsort() function if sorted order is desired.
 *
 * For services such as the "fts(3) traverse a file hierarchy", tree pruning may be performed.
 * In such cases where parts of the file hierarchy are skipped due to tree pruning, no stats about
 * what may have been skipped will be recorded.
 *
 * Due to the number of dynamic arrays used, it is recommended that the application use the
 * walk_free() function when it no longer needs any of the walk_stat information.  This call
 * will free any non-NULL struct dyn_array pointers, re-initialize the set, change name and topdir to NULL,
 * and set all booleans to false.  The use of the walk_free() function should be used with care so
 * that the application does not use any data from the struct walk_stat directly, or if it does
 * use a duplicated and independent copy of that data.
 *
 * Because growing an dynamic array may result in the realloc(3) facility moving data, the
 * application should NOT assume that a pointers within struct walk_stat, or the pointer to
 * the data of a dynamic array, will be unchanged after a walk step.  This is because a walk step
 * may append data to the end of a dynamic array, that in turn may call the realloc(3) facility,
 * and in turn may move the very data that was pointed to before the step.  Therefore an application should
 * always re-access/re-acquire referenced data between each step, or make independent duplicate copies of
 * such data (that won't be subject to realloc(3) facility moving data), or wait until the walk is complete.
 * For this reason, the walking boolean was added.
