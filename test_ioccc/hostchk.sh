# "Because sometimes even the IOCCC Judges need some help." :-)
#
# NOTE: This script is called from make all and if it exits non-zero it will
# issue a warning, suggesting you report it via the bug_report.sh script. That
# script itself will call hostchk.sh which will reissue that warning (more than
# once in fact since make all calls hostchk.sh and bug_report.sh calls it via
# make all and running hostchk.sh directly) and each time it will suggest using
# bug_report.sh.
#
# Obviously one needn't run this script a second or third time just because the
# Makefile and bug_report.sh suggest you do! :-) Sorry (tm Canada) in advance if this
# (to make use of an American English phrase which I will happily do for a pun for a
# pun not made is a wasted opportunity :-) ) throws you for a loop! :-) But now
# that you're in the loop it shouldn't even matter. :-)
#
# This might seem extra verbose or overkill but we feel that if there's an issue
# with hostchk.sh it really is an issue that will likely prevent a successful
# use of this repo so each time the script fails we report the issue since it
# really is likely that, if the script fails, you will be unable to successfully
# use the mkiocccentry repo to submit a correct IOCCC entry.

# set up
#
# attempt to fetch system specific paths to the tools we need
#
# get cc path
CC="$(type -P cc 2>/dev/null)"
# It's possible that a path could not be obtained so we set to defaults in this
# case.
#
# We could do it via parameter substitution but since it tries to execute the
# command if for some reason the tool ever works without any args specified it
# would make the script block (if we did it via parameter substitution we would
# still have to redirect stderr to /dev/null). It would look like:
#
#   ${CC:=/usr/bin/cc} 2>/dev/null
#
# make sure CC is set
