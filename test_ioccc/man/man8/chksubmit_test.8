.SH DESCRIPTION
.B chksubmit_test.sh
tests each file in the
.I test_JSON/workdir/good
and
.I test_JSON/workdir/bad
subdirectories
It uses
.BR find (1)
to look under the good and bad submission directories that must pass or fail respectively.
The files that must pass are in the subdirectory called
.I good
and the files that must fail are in the subdirectory called
.IR bad .
It keeps a log of all the tests in
.I chksubmit_test.log
for later inspection.
