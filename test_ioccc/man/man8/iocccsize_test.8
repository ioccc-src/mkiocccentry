is used on the command line, then the source file
.I mkiocccentry.c
need not exist in the

If
.BI \-Z\   topdir
is not used on the command line, and the source file
.I mkiocccentry.c
is not found in the current directory or the parent of current directory, then this command exits as if there was a command line error.

Once the
