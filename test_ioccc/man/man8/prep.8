.SH DESCRIPTION
.B prep.sh
runs a series of make actions to test the state of any changes prior to making a commit and pull request.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-h
Print help and exit.
.TP
.BI \-v\  level
Set verbosity level to
.I level
(def: 0).
.TP
.B \-V
Print version and exit.
.TP
.B \-e
Exit on first make action error.
.TP
.B \-o
Do not use backup files for flex or bison if either of those tools cannot be used.
Specifically if this option is used the make rule
.B parser\-o
is used instead of
.BR parser .
.TP
.BI \-m\  make
Specify path to
.BR make (1)
command.
.TP
.BI \-M\  Makefile
Path to the Makefile to use.
.TP
.BI \-l\  logfile
Write all details to log file
.I logfile
and write less information to stdout.
.SH EXIT STATUS
.TP
0
all OK
.TQ
1
.B \-h
and help string printed or
.B \-V
and version string printed
.TQ
2
command line error
.TQ
3
Makefile not readable file
.TQ
4
could not make writable log file
.TQ
9
internal error
.TQ
>= 10
some make action exited non-zero
.SH NOTES
.PP
There are two ways that this script should be invoked in order of preference:
.TP
.B make release
run the script with the
.B \-e
and
.B \-o
options.
.TQ
.B make prep
run the script without exiting on the first error and allowing flex or bison backup files
.PP
Although the
.sp
.RS
.ft B
make release
.ft R
.RE
.sp
should be used first it is okay to use
.sp
.RS
.ft B
make prep
.ft R
.RE
.sp
to get a summary of all issues to fix.
However the
.B make release
generally should pass before a commit (if one does not modify the jparse files then one can probably get away with not using
.B make release\c
\&).
.PP
This script is only needed for the repo maintainers prior to a commit and pull request.
.PP
.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
Run the script in a way that aborts on the first error including the inability to use
.B bison
or
.BR flex :
.sp
.RS
.ft B
make release
.ft R
.RE
.PP
Run the script in a more lenient way, specifying a log file to reduce output on stdout:
.sp
.RS
.ft B
 make prep
.ft R
.RE
