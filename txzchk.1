.SH NAME
txzchk \- sanity checker tool used on IOCCC compressed tarballs
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBtxzchk usage: ./txzchk [\-h] [\-v level] [\-q] [\-V] [\-t tar] [\-F fnamchk] [\-T] txzpath
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBtxzchk\fP runs a series of sanity tests on IOCCC compressed tarballs and it is invoked indirectly through \fBmkiocccentry(1)\fP.
.PP
The program runs \fB\-tJvf\fP on the \fItxzpath\fP to list (it does NOT extract) and parses the output of \fBtar(1)\fP, performing a variety of tests on the tarball.
It also runs the IOCCC tool \fBfnamchk(1)\fP on the file, verifying that the tarball is properly named.
.PP
It will also be directly executed by the judges during the judging process of the contests.
This is an important part of the judging process.
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
\fB\-h\fP
Show help and exit.
.PP
\fB\-v\fP
Set verbosity level.
.PP
\fB\-q\fP
Suppresses some of the output.
This does not include warnings, errors or the output of the \fBtar\fP command.
.PP
\fB\-V\fP
Show version and exit.
.PP
\fB\-t\fP
Specify path to \fBtar\fP that accepts the \fB\-J\fP option.
\fBtxzchk\fP checks \fI/usr/bin/tar\fP and \fI/bin/tar\fP if this option is not specified.
.PP
\fB\-F\fP
Specify path to the IOCCC \fBfnamchk(1)\fP tool.
If this option is not specified the program looks under the current working directory and \fI/usr/local/bin\fP.
.PP
\fB\-T\fP
Assume txzpath is a text file; use \fBfopen(3)\fP and \fBfclose(3)\fP instead of \fBpopen(3)\fP and \fBpclose(3)\fP and don't require \fBtar\fP program.
.SH EXIT STATUS
.PP
\fBmain()\fP returns 0 if no issues are found and 1 if there are issues found; if there's an error the end is not reached.
