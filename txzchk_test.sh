# txzchk_test.sh - test txzchk with good and bad tarballs (as text files)
#
# Dedicated to:
#
#	The many poor souls who have been tarred and feathered:
#
#	    "Because sometimes people throw feathers on tar :-( and because
#	    sometimes people try hiding the fact that they're planning on
#	    throwing feathers on the tar." :-)
#
#	And to my wonderful Mum and my dear cousin and friend Dani:
#
#	    "Because even feathery balls of tar need some love." :-)

# setup

# attempt to fetch system specific path to the tools we need
#
# get tar path
TAR="$(type -P tar 2>/dev/null)"
# Make sure TAR is set:
#
# It's possible that the path could not be obtained so we set it to the default
# in this case.
#
# We could do it via parameter substitution but since it tries to execute the
# command if for some reason the tool ever works without any args specified it
# could make the script block (if we did it via parameter substitution we would
# still have to redirect stderr to /dev/null). It would look like:
#
#   ${TAR:=/usr/bin/tar} 2>/dev/null
#
# but due to the reasons cited above we must rely on the more complicated form:
