 * utf8_posix_map - translate UTF-8 into POSIX portable filename and + chars
 *
 * "Because even POSIX needs an extra plus." :-)
 *
 * An author_handle, for an IOCCC winner, will be used to form
 * a winner_handle.  These winner_handle's will become part of a
 * JSON filename on the www.ioccc.org website.  For this reason,
 * (and other reasons), we must restrict an author_handle to
 * only lower case POSIX portable filenames, with the addition of the +,
 * and restrictions on leading characters.
 *
 * The author_handle (and winner_handle) must fit the following
 * regular expression:
 *
 *	^[0-9a-z][0-9a-z._+-]*$
